The B&B is located about a 10 minute walk from the village center. Diana (her really name is Glasyn Gibson) was friendly, welcoming and accommodating. The room with en suite bathroom, was tiny but adequate and had all the features of a big hotel (tea service, a four-poster bed with luxurious bedding, a cushy mattress, a TV with at least 300 channels (I stopped surfing at that point), and a wardrobe and dresser with rooms for lots of dance clothes. The hot water in the shower\u002Ftub was plentiful and very, very hot, which was soothing to aching dance muscles! We chose the full English breakfast at 7:30 a.m. and Mrs. Gibson had the food ready on the dot.  The meal was so ample that we saved our bacon (thick, lean Canadian style meat) each morning and along with a loaf of fresh bread from a street vendor or bakery, it made the perfect lunch. There's parking right next door. We hope to be back next year or the year after to attend the festival -- four days of nonstop dancing, concerts, parades, and events. If you play folk music, contra, square or do English dance, or just want to watch or listen to all that talent, it's a great festival.",5,positive

The house is situated on a major route out of town which can be busy - not too much of a problem for us and we had Room 1 at the front. Parking at a working men's club at the rear is useful and, to be honest, we heard nothing from this direction. Our room, small to begin with, was overly full of unnecessary furniture and felt cramped.TV was small, only one bedside light worked. A sliding door led to the en suite which was no better than OK. Not as clean as it should have been. Room itself led directly into the breakfast room which felt intrusive to us. This room was also small. Breakfast itself was good although served somewhat haphazardly by a different pleasant woman. Overall it served it's purpose but hand on heart we could not recommend it to others. I would normally have made these observations to the owner at the time but, frankly, it simply did not seem worth it.

Meeting me at the door personally, Diana was the perfect host, making me feel immediately at home, just showing me briefly how the door lock worked and then on to my bedroom ( no. 1 ) just beyond the breakfast room, and in doing so, wasn't in the least bit intrusive - more a friend letting me in.\n\nThe lodge in somewhat bijou throughout, and I haven't seen anything to suggest I should have expected otherwise. It is a pretty, late period cottage of hanging-baskets and planters on the junction of a fairly busy main road 10 minutes walking distance from the centre of town. But this is by know means a negative, as it gives great road links and communications, is a good distance from the disturbances of late night bars, has easy parking ( behind in the West End club)  and allows a little exercise prior to finding something to eat, and I found Chippenham a surprisingly neat, little county town.\n\nMy room was supremely clean and tidy, the en-suite perfectly sized for just me, and equally large enough, had I have been sharing. Oversized individuals may feel squeezed. The bed had one of those delicious overlay mattresses on ( they have a name which escapes me now)  which made it a dreamily comfortable night. The linen was fresh and crisp, of a good quality, as were the towels. Hand-pump bottles of soaps are supplied in the bathroom and in the bedroom, a more than adequate quantity of tea and coffee ( decaff also ) on a coffee table. Hair drier supplied and thank God, a bed-side Bible which for me is a sign of caring indulgence not a bible-bash!\n\nBreakfast is chosen from a varied menu, and choice of items and time required is organised more or less on arrival, and is a very good system. A note pad was left out for me with the menu. I chose, noted my requirements, which was whisked away at some stage, and all I had to do was turn up on time ( but getting out of that lovely bed wasn't easy. By the way, Diana's Lodge may be on a main road but I wasn't in the least disturbed. The front windows beyond the en-suite, are hidden behind a very tall fence and hedge, and to the side, is a garden and car area behind a tall gated fence - all very private) . I had the full-English which was freshly cooked and delicious. There were fruit juices, cereals and a bowl of freshly cut mixed fruit. The was also a cooler of chilled waters both spa or tap waters. Tea or coffee, cafettiere or instant, white or whole meal, and how many ways can Diana offer to prepare your egg?\n\nDiana's Lodge is great value for money, on the edge of a lovely little town and boardering some of Britain's finest tourist countryside. It really is superbly sited for day tours in every direction. If I had a regret it was that I couldn't stayed longer!\n\nThank you Diana, I hope one day to be in your area again and stay at Chippenham's first choice in bed and breakfast lodges.\n\nG.

My first night the regular guest rooms were full, but Julie Anne made up a very comfortable sofa bed in a small study that she usually keeps for family visitors at a reduced price. The other two nights I was in the main single-bedded room.\n\nThe rooms are plain, clean and comfortable.

It takes a bit of getting used to, given that hotels and most guest houses now have en suite facilities. \n\nMy only complaint about the bathroom - and it is a minor complaint - is that the shower is one of those that requires one to fiddle around balancing the hot and cold water flow using the taps on the bath itself before pulling up a knob to redirect the water to the shower head. I never managed to achieve a satisfactory temperature - the cold water seemed not to make it through - and the water flow was far from generous.\n\nWhile the beds are comfortable, and the breakfast is magnificent.

chip core only\ca\190801\1491102\126007835.html,London Road Garden Annex,"""At short notice we discovered this terrific self contained B & B (using Trip Advisor and following the reviews). Like others after one night we wished we were staying longer.  Jean & Mike have thought of everything you would need for a home away from home.  Mike is a retired Chef (but still doing outside catering and will cook for you with notice) and Jean is a professional gardener (the small garden outside the unit is delightful and in Spring\u002FSummer I am sure is amazing).  They are very friendly and lay back, just the right balance as immediate neighbours to the unit.  The unit is wonderfully clean and the bed linen is superb, the bed is super comfy.\nIf you were staying for a good length of time you would find the kitchen is brilliant for cooking even a roast dinner, cooking a cake even....there is everything there....even a dishwasher. Mike and Jean leave all the fresh ingredients in the refrigerator so you can cook your own cooked breakfast when you want, unlike other B & B's where you are perhaps locked into a set time. This includes sausages, bacon, eggs, tomatoes, mushrooms and fresh juice....and the wonderful home made fresh bread which greets you on arrival. \nAs others have mentioned the bathroom is a bit different....a deep walk in shower\u002Fbath (an elderly family member in the past needed this provision), the shower has a good supply of hot water.  There are top quality toiletries in the bathroom.  \nFinding the house, which is on a busy road, can be a bit tricky but once you are around the back where the unit is, there is absolutely no sound from the road. Off road parking for one car.  Looking through the guest register comments you can see how many people who have had longer stays have enjoyed all the unit has to offer. Speak to Mike and Jean about a better price on a weekly stay.  We do hope to return for a nice long stay next time.",5,positive

Rooms were clean and comfortable and the hotel was a few minutes walk from the train station which was ideal for the trip into Bath we planned.  The staff were friendly and very helpful.  Breakfasts were standard Travelodge fare and perfectly fine, but the one evening meal we had was a disaster.  It's a fairly limited menu - mostly pizza and burgers - but that was okay, as it was what we wanted at the time.  The problem was that the food was poorly cooked and not very nice at all.  My daughter ordered the house salad as a starter and buttermilk chicken burger as a main course; both arrived together, the salad was swimming in dressing and the coating on the burger was soggy.  I ordered garlic bread with cheese to start and the halloumi burger.  My starter didn't arrive at all until I asked for it, and what turned up looked like a small baguette sliced in half and then sliced in the middle and coated with garlic butter and mozzarella, rather than separate slices of bread as I'd expected, and it was very hard to bite into and chew.  My burger had two patties, both of which were overcooked - in fact, around the edges, they were so tough and rubbery that I suspect they may have been cooked before and then re-cooked or re-heated.  And they were topped with a huge slab of raw halloumi - I had expected it to be cooked.  To be fair, the menu didn't say it was cooked so that assumption was mine, and I like raw halloumi - it just didn't work as a burger topping.\n\nOverall, we enjoyed our stay and would definitely re-visit, but we won't be having any evening meals there!",4,positive

There is free wifi which is great when travelling for business. The showers are great, beds comfy and rooms are a good size. There is also free parking. You can also use the gym and pool for free. \n\nThings to improve: the menu is in need of updating as for the price I would expect a higher quality. The rooms can get cold as there is no air conditioning\u002Fheating, something to address this (particularly in the new annexe) would be good. Finally having to take the case up and downstairs was a bit cumbersome again in the new part a lift would help! \n\nThe hotel has a lovely character to it, I think it's from 1700s, and the owners seem to have worked to preserve this. the staff are a delight and respond very well to requests and feedback, they go the extra mile to provide a personal service.

(We've also been to the Angel for lunch a few times since.)  We had afternoon tea with our family and close friends at the Angel which was okay (I think they didn't like the fact that we hadn't booked our evening reception there) - then, following a big party at a local pub we stayed at the Angel for our wedding night.  The honeymoon suite looks lovely, new bathroom, four poster bed, antique furniture etc...BUT we had the worst night ever there - the four poster bed was so lumpy and small neither of us could sleep - the hotel opposite was having some sort of party and we ended up phoning reception to ask if they could keep the noise down so we could at least get some sleep.  We only live ten minutes away so the next morning we had our breakfast and left as quick as we could (if we hadn't been quite so shattered we would have left in the middle of the night).  My family stayed in the modern annexe and were quite happy with their rooms although they were all amazed how expensive the Angel is - if you compare the rates with other hotels around Europe you may have a shock.  I've given the Angel a 'terrible' rating based on the honeymoon suite - I would give it a 'neutral' for the other rooms because of the outrageous rates.

So my first recommendation is not to expect your room to look like the photos I post here... The majority of rooms are nothing like this size! \n\nThe hotel scores well on a variety of fronts: value for money, location, free wi-fi and overall ambience. The bar area in particular has a variety of sofas and cosy spaces where it's a pleasure to spend time, with small candles added to the table and lights dimmed. The staff are competent and usually friendly, especially to their regulars, and happy to serve briskly at breakfast (where each hot meal is prepared to order). In addition, the guest questionnaire in the room is essentially a blank piece of paper leaving people free to write their own comments, which suggests to me that the hotel is keen to ensure they're not simply carrying out a tick-box exercise. I particularly like the fact that at dinner, if you're resident there's no need to wait to sign the bill (they simply charge the whole meal cost to your room): although don't like the fact that this means the staff tend to miss out on the tips they'd almost certainly receive at other hotels or restaurants. The staff are good enough not to create a system that bypasses rewarding them.\n\nI would also recommend that the reception area is tidied up (allowing residents to see into the back-office with its piles of paper is not a good look) and staff who work there should make more effort to greet residents they recognise by name - and in particular if they're Best Western reward card holders - as well as ensuring their standards of customer care and uniform standards are maintained. On occasions, the key has been virtually dumped on the counter and the \""Would you like a wake-up call or newspaper\"" question forgotten.\n\nBut please don't let that put you off! Overall, this is a well run hotel with clean, good size rooms and more amenities (such as a pool) you'd expect at this price point. The staff all know their jobs well and I'd be very surprised if anybody has an issue staying here. There are many hotels in this area but for a reliable and predictable (in a good way) stay, I'd definltey recommend The Angel.",4,positive

For some reason Best Western, in my mind, conjures up budget hotels with low standards.\n\nOn arrival I was amazed by the size of our room (room 111 is a huge family room) as well as the hotel having an indoor swimming pool to keep our son occupied. The total price was \u00A3120 including breakfast (very good bacon). The room had a large sofa bed, incredibly comfortable king-sized bed, and a very large LG tv (possibly 47\"").\n\nHeavy wooden doors throughout the main part of the hotel give the impression that someone has thought about the interior rather than just opting for the cheapest alternative. Part of the dining room also has a mix-and-match approach to the chairs to give the feeling of a boutique hotel rather than a one-size-fits-all, generic chain.\n\nOn our arrival we were feeling tired, and so we decided to eat in the hotel. Again, not holding out much expectation of a decent meal I was hugely surprised by the cost and quality. We opted for the steak deal which, for \u00A322, offered two sirloin steaks and a bottle of wine. Usually sirloin is a tricky cut to get right, but these were incredibly tender and cooked perfectly (and delicious). Having lived in France, I know how the French rarely cook their steaks correctly - I just didn't expect them to be trumped by a Best Western in Chippenham! Whilst the steaks were seared, they had then, correctly, been finished in the oven to allow for the inside to be cooked. Our rare steaks (NB not RAW - as you would often find them) were perfect.\n\nEveryone whether it was the cleaning staff, reception or bar\u002Frestaurant staff was incredibly polite and friendly and the central phone booking line was very efficient.

The car park is outside the new part which you then have to walk through and across an open quadrangle to reach reception.  We had no trouble parking but there was a shortage of space later on.  Apparently the gate has to be put down at times to discourage people who are just using it as a public carpark.  If you go outside through the old part you are in the town centre.

We booked 3 rooms last year after the last visit to Badminton, as usual we arrived last night at the Angel  Hotel very tired after a very early start and long drive from (2 couples) from North Yorkshire and (one couple) from Shropshire. We had spent the day walking the course and shopping, so ready for a hot shower and a nice relaxing drink in the bar. What a shock and disappointment! to be told the Hotel had no bookings in our names, this was despite the Hotel ringing one of our party 4 weeks previous to check we still wanted the rooms, which of course we confirmed yes we did. The young duty manager did his best to deal with the situation but unfortunately he failed to handle the problem very professionally, instead of taking us into a quiet corner and offering us a drink while he tried to get to the bottom of the situation, he allowed us to stand around  in the foyer in front of other customers trying to  have a relaxing drink and he could not explain to us what had gone wrong with our booking. He confirmed that the hotel was full and we could not stay there. He then left us standing around while he tried to find us alternative accommodation. He eventually found us another Hotel in Swindon which is 45 minutes away! We had planned to be back in Badminton early on Sunday to see the trot up, obviously that was not going to be possible due to the distance. The young duty manager did accept responsibility and showed enough grace to apologise even though clearly it was not his fault. He promised that the hotel manager Damian would call us this afternoon, this call has only added to our disappointment, anger and frustration, as Damian didn't bother to apologise and indicated that he didn't really believe that we had booked the rooms! Does he really think we would drive all that way on Badminton weekend and just hope they would have 3 rooms!  I would suggest that Damian is sent on a course to improve his skills in customer service. I have a business and  in my experience reputation is everything. We all understand that sometimes things can go wrong, but the way this has been dealt with has left us with a very bad impression of this Hotel, and we will never go back there again. I would also think that all of the customers having a drink last night must have felt very uncomfortable. Very disappointing experience after being loyal customers for several years. I would suggest to anyone who thinks they have booked a room here to ring and email for a conformation that your room is actually available and has not been sold to someone else!!!!!",1,negative

The bed was probably the firmest I have ever had in my travels, it was sold as four poster but it was actually just four curtain drapes in the corners.  The controls of one of the radiators was inoperable, the wardrobe was in poor condition and there were panel pins sticking out that could easily cause damage to people and clothes, the bath plug was not attached to the chain, the hot water went cold occasionally, the consumables were not topped up and the quality of the paper products was poor.   The free high speed internet was a plus.  However dinner in the hotel was exceptionally good.  We were having a family gathering and everyone agreed that the food and service was excellent and good value.    It was the food that made me rate as very good rather than average.

Nearby is a small shopping centre. The hotel car park can become crowded but we never found a problem parking.\nWe stayed in the new building which opens on to an attractive courtyard garden with benches and gazebos with a short walk to the main hotel and its reception, restaurant and function rooms.\nThe new building also includes a swimming pool and a gym for the use of guests. Our room, 201, was over the gym and the background noise of TVs could be heard which was mentioned to reception who immediately sent someone to turn them down. On another occasion shouting could be heard from guests in the gym for a short while. It was only heard in the background but was still a little irritating. This appeared to affect just the rooms directly over the gym, and to be fair it was not a constant noise, nor was it late at night and would depend not only on how many guests used gym, but also on how noisy they were, but it is a point to consider.\nThe room itself was clean and large, with a king size double, free Wi-Fi, tea and coffee making facilities, hair dryer, toiletries, a large TV and adequate plugs and storage. There were plenty of towels and bedding and, apart from the occasional noise from below, the room was quiet with no traffic noise.\nStaff were all helpful and friendly and breakfast is excellent with a well-cooked full English plus a range of self-serve cereals and extensive Continental items.\nWe ate in the restaurant twice where the food was good and reasonably priced. There was a problem with a steak on the second occasion, it looked fine but a large portion was inedible. Staff dealt with it commendably quickly, efficiently and satisfactorily though, with an apology and a minimum of fuss, which says much more about the hotel and staff than the serving of a poor steak.\nDuring the day the hotel lounge and bar area seems to be popular as a regular meeting place for coffee and cakes for locals and the cakes on offer did look tempting.\nChippenham itself is a pleasant enough market town with an interesting history, the Danes surrendered to King Arthur at Chippenham apparently. The town's history is well told in the small museum next to the hotel.\nThe town is on the edge of the Cotswolds and close to Bath so is a reasonable centre for exploring the area.",4,positive

There is alternative parking close by but, all of this time restricted during the day, but unrestricted between 6.00pm and 8.00am.\nThe view of the front of the hotel is in the pedestrianised centre. Which only has access for Taxis. You will approach the modern rear of the building.  The Angel is a period hotel with a modern extension which you will walk through to reach the reception in the old building.  I stayed in the old period building which has lots of quirks, which have been screened by an ill conceived modern look. \n\nThe reception area itself has the feel of an afterthought. It looks like a converted broom cupboard with a stainless steel or aluminium screen which does not lend itself to a welcome for the visitor. The staff are friendly and helpful. Being in the old part of the building there are sudden level changes the receptionist warns you of and I part fell into my room as the step up is immediately behind the door as you open it.\nOn the plus side the room size is generous, excellent bed with a big bath\u002Fshower room. The lighting though was dim. There was a dimmer switch but I could not raise the light level. During my stay, there was no hot water before 6.00am and I could not get any hot water in the shower for the two days I stayed. The carpet looked a little grubby. Not unhealthy but probably ready for a clean and the bath mat towel was frayed. \nBar  area expansive though a little small, again clean, very modern, functional without being welcoming. Pricing is standard hotel, personally I thought the wine expensive, but I can be difficult to please. Restaurant is a good size, service is slow, and the menu limited a wide choice of steaks but as an example if you wanted fish there was just fish and chips. Observing other tables there was a good selection of vegetables for those who ordered them. Again very friendly and attentive staff. I had mussels which were overcooked, I think this was a matter of timing as I was with a group. So okay but not recommended as a dining experience.

Your GPS might lead you to the front part of the hotel, but that is for taxis and drop-off only. There is a car-free plaza right in front of the hotel so the parking lot is actually in the back part of the property, near the newer section of the hotel. Adequate amount of parking space, except for when an event was held in one of the hotel's meeting rooms on one of the nights.\n\nIn order to get to the reception desk from the parking lot, you walk through the newer building (where gym and pool are), out the back door into a lovely courtyard with trees, flowers, and some tables, then back into the older part of the complex and head down a hallway towards the front. The small, metallic, modern reception desk, as another reviewer stated, is really odd and out of place with the old-time charm and decor of the hotel. At first we weren't even sure that was where we checked in. There is a pleasant, comfortable seating area with wonderful decor just inside the front door near the plaza. You can have drinks and snacks in here, too.\n\nWe headed up to our room, carrying our somewhat heavy suitcases up the stairs (no elevator). A little quirky to get to our room: we went through another narrow passageway that had a few steps, and then opened a few doors to get to our room. We did enjoy our very spacious, clean room with a four-poster bed (with a bench at the foot of it), fireplace, huge closet, large desk and chair, dresser with flat screen tv on it, two bedside tables, a tall standing fan, and lounge chair with footstool. There were also two windows in the room, with little alcoves that held seat cushions. Lovely atmosphere all around!\n\nThe bathroom was quite large, also, and had a window with a cushioned seat bench underneath it. Long counter area above the sink and toilet area to store personal items. The tub had a shower, which worked just fine.\n\nWe ate breakfast and dinner in the restaurant. Staff was pleasant and capable at all meals. Breakfast was buffet, with not a lot of selection, but it was adequate. You could also order additional hot items from the server, too. The dinner menu offered some really delicious food and we enjoyed all of it.\n\nOur only problem was noise, which bothered us two out of the four nights (weekend nights) due to our room's location. The hotel is located next to a bar and the revelers were out shouting and partying on the plaza until the wee hours of the morning. In addition, a wedding party was drinking and screaming in the courtyard for several hours--we complained the next morning to the receptionist who said the hotel was aware of that problem and would handle the situation. \n\nWe chose this hotel because of its close location to Bath--perhaps a 20 minute drive--and also because of the good reviews and adequate parking.

The hotel is right on the Market Place and has a very cleverly built extension at the rear which provides a lovely courtyard\u002Fsitting area, additional accommodation and a good sized car park. \nWe are 'sheets and blankets' people and always ask for them instead of duvets if possible and nine times out of ten, our request gets lost somewhere along the way and we have to ask housekeeping to come and put things right. However, not The Angel Hotel. We were delighted as it saves so much hassle if they get it right first time. Well done to housekeeping and as a result we slept really well in our room which was both spacious and well furnished.\nWe had our meal in the dining room. The service was excellent but we thought the food was rather average. My steak was very chewy and the chips were soggy. The promised field mushroom was replaced with a few button mushrooms scattered on the plate. The batter on my husband's fish was lacking crispness and the fish was quite small. Presentation was very basic. I suggest they invest in better quality frozen chips or do their own 'twice fried' chips and maybe serve them in some little individual chip baskets so that the chips stay crisp and the whole presentation is improved. A little imagination from the head chef is desperately needed.\nI ordered rhubarb & ginger sponge for afters but it was not available and my husband's fresh fruit salad was, again, very basic. No berry fruits at all, not even a strawberry or raspberry (now in season) among the usual apple, pear, kiwi and orange. Very dull indeed. \nUnfortunately the food offer was no better the next day at breakfast. Having said that, there was a good selection of cereals and bits and pieces to go on top, dried fruits, nuts etc. which were fine plus a basic selection of whole fruit, apples mainly and one banana which I grabbed. There was then a choice of the usual cooked breakfast with a choice of eggs. My husband chose a poached egg which, when it arrived was so overcooked it was solid and inedible. I had the buffet and I have never seen such a tiny offering of cheeses and meats, never mind the bread offer which consisted of cold dry croissants, just out of the packet I imagine, some anaemic looking rolls that looked like the cheap long-life ones that need to be baked off, except they didn't look as if they had been, and one, yes one, tiny Danish pastry, similarly pale and looking rather sad. I have a personal hatred of foil butter portions and plastic jam portions, which I suspect come straight from the cash and carry. Why they can't offer better quality jam and butter, I just don't understand. We go to hotels a lot for short breaks now that we are retired and we look forward to a lovely selection for breakfast (the best part of the stay in my opinion), so breakfast for us was a real let-down at The Angel and, we both thought, one of the least impressive that we have had in many a year. \nThis is a lovely hotel that needs to get its act together regarding the quality and presentation of their food which is really letting the hotel down.",3,negative

I had to ask a kind man where the Reception was and he told me to walk through the lovely garden though an old door and I would see the desk.  I personally think that larger signage is required as the garden is like a enclosed beer garden with a winding path leading to the small door of the main hotel.  The receptionist was really friendly and welcoming, and instructions to our accommodation were very clear (though the garden)  but very, very clean and quiet. The only downside was that we decided have some lunch and ordered some sandwiches which took nearly an hour to come!  The restaurant only had a few people in it and so we could not see the hold-up so we asked where our lunch was.  They soon arrived.  On the flip side, in the morning we sat down for breakfast and literally and I mean literally before I had even sat down I was asked for my order!  I scrambled for my glasses and grabbed for the menu.  I was so flustered that I ordered the full breakfast with poached egg instead of fried.  The egg was not cooked at all! The sausage looked aneamic. And literally before I had even ordered the breakfast it soon arrived on the table (maybe that's why my egg was so under cooked!).  Plus, I didn't even get to eat my bran thinking that my breakfast was going to take ages because of our experience with the lunch the day before!",4,positive

Was nice looking out onto the town square with the Christmas tree in it too. Would honestly give the place 5 stars, however the restaurant and bar is THAT awful that I've given it the rating I have. 55 minutes wait for a sandwich and a baked potato (that we had to send back because it was wrong) and then once the sandwich had come back it was too disgusting to eat. Also, 3.50 for a pint of coke? That's the most I think I've ever paid for a draught coke and i think taking advantage of guests like that shows total contempt for them (we all know it costs a few pence at most). Then in the morning there was the breakfast debacle - well over an hour for a revolting inedible breakfast (that they have the cheek to charge \u00A312 per person for)!! We'd paid for breakfast as part of our rate which was annoying as we'd have left otherwise. It wasn't just us suffering, a couple near us just cancelled after 45 mins of waiting and just left and people were openly laughing and mocking the service. A couple next to us received the wrong order after their wait. All the lady had ordered was three boiled eggs and she got three fried ones. She was told it would take another 20 minutes!!! Yes 20 for some boiled eggs to replace those ones! We ate what we could and left, very angry. Clearly they were understaffed but that's not the guests fault, that's managements fault - They should have been giving everybody free breakfast for how awful it was and refunding \u00A312 each for everybody who had already paid. But no - sod all of the paying guests and take no responsibility for the mess.

Nice hotel, conveniently located and tastefully presented with pleasant and helpful staff.\n\nBedroom was well furnished, clean and comfortable although as a twin room it seemed churlish to have only one packet of biscuits and one hot chocolate sachet. Wifi was good and the only downside was that noise was discernible from adjacent rooms and the outside corridor but didn't disturb our sleep.\n\nBathroom adequate, and although it didn't really have an impact upon our stay there were many cracked floor tiles and the sink plug hole hadn't been cleaned properly for quite some time.\n\nBar quite expensive, but then what hotel isn't these days?\n\nFood was similar to a couple of the other reviews already here. The rationale on the  dinner for our big group was to deliver similar meals (we had pre-ordered) to each table and then other choices in turn, meaning some people had to wait a few minutes until all at the table were served and then a further wait for the vegetables. My roast was so cold, despite being on a hot plate, that after one mouthful I asked for it to be re-heated. A new plate was then supplied, but the food was again only luke warm and had been put on a cold plate and it again went back! The third attempt was successful, but by that time the vegetables were decidedly cool but I put up with it whilst my partner hardly eat anything at all. The whole table thought it a poor way of doing things. Of the food, the beef was very chewy and my starter of soup was sadly lacking of a tomato taste  whilst the prawn cocktail delivered to my partner (and some of the others) was the most tasteless I have come across ( I tried it) and I am told  the plaice dish was much the same. The fruit salad was 'fresh' but although there was the odd piece pineapple, orange  and mango, the majority of it was apple and seemed a bit of a cheap way of doing it - perhaps I was unlucky in my serving, but I overheard another of the party asking for an apple free plate?\n\nBreakfast was quite good, although on the second morning we had to ask someone to take our order when despite having a reasonable number of waiters\u002Fwaitresses they were all frantically clearing away tables. Once ordered the food was hot and quickly delivered.\n\nI suspect being in a large group in a separate dining room may have lead to the quality being suspect, but I feel sorry for any wedding party  who suffered similarly.  What is wrong with serving one table at a time so food is hot and everyone is able to start together?\n\nPerhaps the management need to attend to a few things, but I would go back if I needed accommodation in the area?",4,positive

I found the Hotel room comfortable and roomy although it was very hot at night and the Windows could only open an inch or two as we were on the ground floor. It was very quiet which was surprising given the location of the Hotel and that our window faced the car park. The staff were very friendly and accommodating.\nThe thing that let the whole weekend experience down was the quality of the food. I ended up having very little to eat over the weekend as the food was not good. I had the prawn cocktail on the first night and it had absolutely NO taste whatsoever. It was like eating water. They brought me some extra lemon to try and give it some flavour. This was followed by cold beef and cold Yorkshire puddings. I was served first at a table of six and had to sit for ages waiting for the others to be served and then for the vegetables to arrive. The beef was very tough and the meal was returned to the kitchen but the replacement meal was no better, still cold and on a cold plate. The next night I ordered the mackerel pate and the fish thinking that was the safest option. The pate arrived with two of the tiniest pieces of Melba toast, not enough to put the pate on, and the fish was again absolutely tasteless. I had ordered the fruit salad which promised to be fresh and all I got was a plate full of chopped apple.\nI think something really needs to be done when serving food to a table. Everyone should get their food at the same time and it should be hot. The staff were apologetic and did what they could to help but if the food is leaving the kitchen cold and tasteless then there is little they can do.\nThe Hotel was very nice but the food let the weekend down.

Well, not today, unfortunately.  It was bland with a strange creamy colour.  Usually, it's white with a fresh fish flavour.  I did eat about half of it, but was concerned that it might be off, so I sent it back.  The chef said, that it was alright, but it was just the way it was prepared.  As I was still hungry I ordered the carrot & coriander soup to replace it, but was told as I had eaten half of the fish, I would have to pay for the soup as well. I would have expected as a gesture of courtesy and to ensure customer satisfaction, not to mention repeat business, that they might have offered me the soup free of charge.  However, when the soup arrived I could not believe it as it was so unpalatable, i.e. hot and peppery, I was unable to eat it.  I can't help thinking that the chef deliberately over-spiced it as I had complained about the fish tasting bland.

chip core only\ca\190801\192922\492562948.html,Best Western Plus Angel Hotel,"""I am currently staying at the Best Western Angel Plus Chippenham hotel.  I booked this mainly because it was a Best Western which I have always had good experiences with and also because this hotel is pet friendly.  I don't expect Best Western to be 5 star but in general they are always clean and have good service.  I am totally disappointed by my stay at this hotel.  It is very rare that I write a poor review but in this instance one is warranted.  On arrival we could not get any parking in the car park.  It is very small and was totally full. I was told to park in a car park next door (down street). I asked if I had to pay for this and was told I did.  This is an hourly charge with a max of two hours stay, so what was I to do with my car then?  I stayed in the car until a space finally became available.  Not a good start.  \n\nI had two rooms booked, one for myself and my husband and the other for my mam.  There is no elevator in the hotel. One room was on the top floor and the other on the ground.  The ground floor room was taken by my elderly mam as she could not climb two long flights of stairs.  My room was a nice size.  The decor was modern and no issues with that.  However I do have an issue with the cleanliness of the rooms.  The toilet in the room doesn't look like it has seen a brush in years, probably since it was installed. It is grotty down in it, brown to be exact.  The two cups provided were stained both inside and out.  We were given one packet of biscuits every day for two people.....great for figure!  We used the glasses provided in room every day, and every day after the room was cleaned we had to wash our own glasses as they were left dirty beside the bed.  One day the towel provided was stained.  Needless to say we threw that on the floor and shared the other towel between us.  We made coffee in the room on the first day (after washing the cups well!) and the next day the sugar was not replenished, so tough if you need a second cup during your stay and take sugar, as there was none provided.  The second day when we returned there was a long black hair hanging off the edge of the bath....not ours as we dont have long black hair!\n\nWe were staying for 4 nights.  On the second day we left the hotel at 10am and returned at 4pm to find the room was not cleaned, even though we hung the 'make up room' sign on the door.  I rang housekeeping and they said they would clean it then. I had to go sit in reception for 30 mins with our pet while they cleaned it.  Housekeeping said that the checkin guest rooms takes priority.  But that night the carpark wasnt nearly full and I would say according to the number at breakfast the hotel was far from full, so not sure why our room was not prioritised.\n\nThe second room although a better experience was still not cleaned well and hair was left in the bathroom from another guest.\n\nI complained to reception on the 3rd morning about the cleanliness of the room. All she said was 'did I mention it the day before', which I said I didn't, so she said she would mention it to housekeeping. Needless to say nothing much improved on day 3 apart from the glasses being washed for us ....thank you!.  The toilet is still brown and grotty.  Not sure if they cant afford a toilet brush!  Surely there is a housekeeping manager that oversees the rooms to ensure the standard is maintained?\n\nBreakfast is OK, nothing amazing.  Buffet is pretty poor\u002Fbasic, just some cereals, no prunes or anything out of the norm.  Hopefully you are not in a hurry though as it took 30-35 mins to get a fry served to us, by which time the toast was stone cold and the coffee to.  They must have had to go to shop to get the contents before they could start cooking. They were not even busy. Just a few tables in use when we were there and several waitresses present, so no excuse for taking so long.  \n\nThe hotel is OK but very poor on a number of fronts.  I wouldn't recommend it if you have a choice.  We moved from Best Western Crudwell to this Best Western due to lack of availablilty for the remainder of our stay at the Crudwell Best Western.  The Best Western Crudwell is much older hotel, but was a fantastic stay and the staff could not have done enough for you.  They were truly amazing and have perfected the customer relations piece.  Pity about the Chippenham Best Western.  I am not sure how they got 'Angel' and 'Plus' status, but they need to work on their housekeeping and overall customer service.  This is the first time I have stayed in a 'Plus' Best Western, so was truly disappointed.  Even mentioning to reception that I was not happy didn't improve anything! Its like they just couldn't care less.\n\nOn a positive they have free WIFI and it is not bad, but you have to connect every day. No big deal. They also have a small pool and gym, but I didn't use these.  The other plus is that they are pet friendly which is great!",3,negative

Our room was a good size with a warm, comfortable bed and a spacious bathroom. WiFi was free, easy to use and provided a good signal. The food was well-cooked, tasty and served promptly, even when our large party of 48 were eating at the same time. Drinks at the bar were fairly expensive but that is not uncommon in a hotel like this. The Angel is an old coaching inn with lots of history and character, probably with planning restrictions limiting the amount of change permitted. Bedrooms inside the main building reflect this, with uneven floors and fairly small windows. By contrast, our bedroom in the annex befitted the modern building that it was. The disadvantage of the annex was the dash across to the main building when raining. There are no lifts in the hotel but staff were on hand to carry heavy cases upstairs.  The staff were all efficient and helpful and the young duty manager was on hand throughout the weekend, greeting us on arrival and ensuring prompt service in the restaurant. She even came to check that our departure went smoothly and wished us a safe journey. A few minor points needing attention were reported on departure but, overall, this was a very enjoyable stay in a good hotel.",4,positive

Its not been right for MONTHS and is a disgrace.  The new Manager has reduced the temperature to 29 degrees which he thinks is fine - he won't get in to try it though, and it is freezing cold and most unpleasant.

As he walked away I asked if we might then have a second larger glass but he made no response and no such glass was ever brought to us. When I raised the matter with him on departing he muttered something and retreated to the back of the bar where I couldn't see him. I should mention that I'm a 68 year-old male, have dined in some of the finest hotels in the world and just because my wife and I had taken advantage of a promotional offer I saw no reason why we should have been treated with such derisive contempt.

The hotel itself was fine - usual comfy beds, clean rooms and pretty much what you\u2018d expect.\n\nWe took the \u2018Meal Deal\u2018 which involved \u2018enjoying\u2018 breakfast and evening meals at the adjacent Brewers Fayre.\n\nTip 1: Unlike (I\u2018m certain) at other chains, with which Premier Inn partners - the Meal Deal in this location offers nothing in the evenings for Children accompanying paying Adults - therefore, our 14 year old was charged Adult prices for her evening meals - which somewhat eroded the value of taking the Meal Deal. It was also noted that the most expensive of all the items chosen were those billed. Hmmm.\n\nTip 2: If dining on the Meal Deal - then ensure that you mention this before ordering. We didn\u2018t, and the server then needed to cancel and re-order the entire meal a second time. The staff also seemed rather confused as to why we wanted to order 3 meals, whereas there were only 2 of us on the Meal Deal (Hint: Because, our 14 YO daughter got free breakfasts in any case...) - on the first evening this meant that it took the best part of 15 mins to place the order. Oh, yes - and it\u2018s all payment at the bar, up front.\n\nTip 3: Decline side orders: Onion rings - \u00A31.99 for TWO rings. Mushrooms - \u00A31.99 for 10 button mushrooms. Bargain!\n\nTip 4: Seriously - consider taking your own mugs for hot drinks at breakfast. On both mornings that we were there, the mugs ran out, and took an age to be replenished. Just buy more mugs, already!\n\nThe staff in general, appeared rather harassed and overworked - I suspect that there were not really enough of them rostered. Not their fault.\n\nIn conclusion, I realise that it\u2018s not Premier Inn\u2018s issue and that this review has been much more about the catering venue than accommodation per se - but the partnership with Brewers Fayre in this particular location would actively motivate us to look elsewhere to stay on a return visit.",3,negative

In this day and age isn't it about time Premier Inn had Twin bedrooms rather than one in a King Size bed that can't be split, the other person on what is at best described as a small sofa with bed made up on it, so hard didn't get a winks sleep on the two nights we stayed. Was told at reception they don't have twin rooms as such and in future to ask for a quilt to be wrapped around the sleeping surface to try and make it a bit more comfortable. Given up purchasing breakfasts at Premier Inn as you can always get far better and so much cheaper in any other Cafe\u002Fsupermarket etc, it's not that well presented, doesn't have what we asked for so again, brought our own cereal and milk and ate out later as required. Bathroom is fine, towels have been cut back from 2 bath Towels and 2 Hand a Towels to just one of each between two people. Talk about money pinching. The standards with regards to charges have really dropped in our opinion, the refurbished Travel Lodges are now tapping at Premier Inns door and over \u00A310 a night cheaper minimum. Plenty of free car parking here, and a Morrison fuel station and supermarket on opposite junction of roundabout. Beds are just covered over, no remake or straightening of bottom sheet. I could go on but won't.\nOn second visit we had the quilt wrapped around the base of sofa which is used as a bed even for a adult, and was more comfortable but how anyone is expected to get a good nights sleep in this I don't know. The free internet although welcome is just far to slow and limiting, it is far easier and quicker to connect to the 4G on my phone. The 40\"" TV is good and at a reasonable height, but you really need more than one PowerPoint at side of bed.\nThird visit was as good as it was going to get here, avoid if you can, very noisy, but that's down to families and their uncontrolled kids.\nStaff try to be helpful, but can be slow, this last visit wasn't on ground floor or a twin as booked but on next floor as a double. Waited to get relocated and room sorted, done eventually but just generally shows the very poor management of this particular Premier Inn. If they are all going for penny pinching now, they will find less customers and many more claims for bad nights. Didn't bother reporting faults with room on our last visit, but now have found a much better establishment to use in the future when in Wiltshire.

However it was a bit confusing at the beginning to find my room as all of them are located chaotically. \nThe location is good if you have a car or a shuttle is organized, as the city of Bath is in 30 minutes drive from the Hotel.\nThere is no breakfast buffet inside  the hotel, but there is an on site restaurant called \""Brewers Fayre\"" which I would highly recommend NOT to drop in as the food and the service there is the worst I could ever imagine. I stayed there for 4 days and from the first day the coffee machine was not functioning well and water was all over the floor coming out of the coffee machine. Seemed like no one really cared for it. The serving staff could keep you waiting for half an hour before they would approach you, and the food was crap. The food was reheated in a microwave, the forks, spoons, knives, plates and cups were EXTREMELY dirty. In a word, never attend the \""Brewers Fayre\"". There is a big supermarket in 5 minutes walk, one would better purchase something there to eat.",4,positive

Really pleased, till we went for our meal.  Because we had travelled over 4 hours to get to Premier inn, we didn't want to travel again to eat, so booked the Brewers Fayre, which was recommended by the hotel. What a mistake that was.  First we had to queue to tell the staff We were there, (I booked the table on line). After taking us to our seats, I asked if we could order drinks, and we were directed to a log line at the bar....... After 25 minutes, our husbands got to the front of the queue and we got one round of drinks!  We were told to go to the bar to order the food.  Again we waited approx 30 minutes to get to the front of the bar, making our conversations disjointed!!!  I wish we hadn't bothered, the food was terrible, and cold!!! No excuse, I had scampi and chips, cold and 'obviously warmed in a microwave' it was disgusting and not edible.  When we queried the staff, we were told that since the 'living wage' was introduced they had to lay off 15 staff members!!!!!!!  The staff were very hard working, and doing their best, but it was a ridiculous situation.  I made the mistake of trying to order coffee, I was  directed to a coffee machine - no cups, no clean teaspoons, no coffee beans in the machine and lastly no milk in the machine.   And then they have the ordacity to charge me!!!!  Not a happy bunny and won't eat in a Whitbread restaurant again. Unfortunately we had already booked our breakfast too, and that was no better, no cornflakes, no thick sliced bread as advertised? it was very thin, The fresh fruit, was very limited, and out of tins, Penny pinching or what?  No clean teaspoons again.  I felt that I was always asking the staff to get me things.  Not good enough Whitbread, u r a large company, either take less in dividends, or to be honest I would have paid a pound or two extra, to get better service, and decent edible food.  Your staff were doing their best, but with the best will in the world, they can't divide themselves to accommodate for all the missing staff.  Hope you address this situation very quickly.

Bedding is always a challenge when travelling as a family. My husband and I like a big bed and my 9 & 11 year olds are getting to a stage where they want their own bed too.  Premier Inns have this market covered!  \n\nAt Chippenham, our room was wall to wall beds as they were all made up for us when we arrived. How refreshing!  A large Queen for us (we usually book kings), A convertible day bed and another roll-away that seemed to pop up from below the Queen.  It was, as the locals say, 'brilliant'!  We slept well every night...and this is from someone who sleeps on an adjustable tempur-pedic style bed at home.\n\nBeing that the room was wall to wall to beds, I also noticed how well planned the luggage space was.  There was a small shelf with power for charging, a built in hairdryer and a lighted mirror.  As the mom, I didn't feel like I was struggling with the kids and dad for space to get ready.\n\nWe didn't plan to eat at the restaurant but we had arrived in Chipp on Sunday night and there wasn't much else open.  We heard that the restaurant is quite popular because it's one of the only places open late.  Again, it was convenient and our food was fine. We stuck with local fare.  Hmmm, we found that ordering at the bar was pretty prevalent everywhere in the countryside, we got used to it...!

The lady on Reception, Karen, was lovely and very helpful. The stay would have been unbearable without her. The place has had multiple extensions and boasts loooong corridors vaguely reminiscent of The Shining. I had a heavy case and had to lug it up to the first floor (no lift, up a narrowish staircase where it's impossible for two people with baggage to pass each other). No restaurant so I had to make my way, skirting the car park to the local pub chain which is very close by. If it could be fried it was on the menu - not much to offer for those not wanting a calorie bomb. They do a nice line in loud blues music (which I like) but not at breakfast time. When I got up after my first night's stay I realised my duvet cover had a coffee stain. There was no one on reception when I left so I called the hotel on my way to work and asked them to change my bed linen. The woman on reception (not Karen) was vaguely interested and said it would be dealt with. When I got back that evening nothing had been done about my bedding and there was no record of my having called. This is appalling.

Large tables have had 'Reserved' signs on them each day but in 3 mornings weve never seen anyone sit at them. Each morning the juices have ran out and we have had to request they are refilled. Each time 1 carton of juice is poured into the jug for it to be emptied 30 seconds later by thirsty customers, this is an hour and a half before breakfast service closes. Both coffee machines stopped working this morning, one ran out of milk and the other needed the coffee grinds emptying.

I checked in online which was supposed to save time when I arrived, but the machine didn't produce my room 'key' (card) so human intervention was needed. So - not much point to the online check in .... \nThe room itself was clean and pleasant, very comfortable bed. The bathroom was spotless and looked as if it was newly refurbished. It was very warm overnight; the window only opens a very small amount - necessary for safety, and a small fan was provided in the room. I'm glad I wasn't staying last week in the very hot weather. My room (120) overlooked the back of the Brewer's Fare buliding and there was a lot of noise from their air con\u002F fan outlets (?) so I had to close my window to get to sleep. I also had an unlovely view of the bins !!\nThe main corridors look like they could do with freshening up . \nThere is no lift up to the first floor - hard work if,as many travellers do - you are lugging heavy suitcases. When I queried this at reception I was told that a lift wasn't deemed necessary as there was 'only one floor upstairs, and the building is 15 years old' .... \nThe PI is badly let down by the adjacent Brewer's Fare. I arrived mid evening after a long drive so didn't feel up to venturing elsewhere for a meal. The staff are friendly and helpful, but 2 of the staff serving were clearly inexperienced and the service was very slow. I ordered steak and although I wasn't particularly in a hurry I had to ask a couple of times if my order was on its way. When it came the meal was barely wam and rather underwhelming... \nBoth the exterior and interior of the building are shabby and outdated. Outside there are weeds all around it and a very tatty looking children's play area. Inside many of the seats are shabby and stained. It all needs at the very least a good clean, but really a total refurbishment. I prepaid for breakfast, and it wasn't bad, just didn't want to linger in this dingy environment.\nSo in summary - the Premier Inn is good value, and in a convenient location but request a room on the ground floor if you're not feeling particularly fit.

There was surprisingly little traffic noise from the adjoining A350 which forms the main route into Chippenham, which made for good sleeps. \n\nWe took up the meal deals for breakfast and dinner and were glad that we booked a table as it the restaurant was very busy, particularly on the Monday night.

The hotel is on the outskirts of the town and is quite close to the M4 motorway which was our reason for choosing this it as we wished to break up a long journey. The hotel was easy to find and there is plenty of free parking on site.\nWe had checked in online, however, the machine in the lobby that is supposed to issue keys to those who have checked in wasn\u2019t working properly, fortunately, a member of staff was able to rectify this situation promptly, we were told that it was not uncommon for the machine to fail to operate. First impressions of our room were good \u2013 clean, well maintained, a reasonable size and with all the standard amenities that one expects to find in a Premier Inn bedroom. Unfortunately, things went downhill a little when we discovered that the toilet didn\u2019t flush and there was no hot water. My husband went to reception to report the problem and was told that the water had been turned off in order to fix a plumbing problem but hopefully would be turned on again shortly. Whilst we realise that a plumbing issue can occur anywhere at anytime we feel that we should have been told of this on our arrival \u2013 it is not ideal to find the toilet will not flush after it has been used!. It is, of course, possible that the receptionist was just under the impression that it was just the hot water supply that was affected, however, as this type of problem could occur again I feel that management need to  train staff to find out full details of the nature of any problem and relay them promptly to customers. Fortunately, there was a large Morrison\u2019s supermarket just across the road from the hotel that did have flushing toilets and a plentiful supply of hot water (it also has a caf\u00E9). Unfortunately, one of the lamp- posts that illuminate the hotel drive was not working so it was a little difficult to see the pathway to the hotel exit, moreover, traffic entering the hotel may have found it difficult to see us!\nAfter our visit to Morrisons we returned to the hotel and thankfully the plumbing was fixed. We ate our evening meal at the on site Brewers Fayre restaurant which offers traditional pub type meals at reasonable prices. We noted that if you go early that it was possible to get some very good meal deals. The food was good and we both enjoyed our meals. \nOverall, this is quite a good Premier Inn but due to the problems we encountered can only be awarded 3 stars on this occasion, however, this would not deter me from staying here again should I be in the area in the future.",3,negative

Firstly they have a computerised check in service which I ended up having to get the lady at the check in desk to help me with  as work had booked my room and I didn't know the postcode used for the booking. In the end it would have just been quicker with the traditional process of a person checking you in. Your room key and food vouchers all get printed out of the machine.\nThe room itself was as expected, however mine in particular was tucked away in the corner of the hotel and had the slightest of damp smells to it. On top of this the shampoo dispenser was broken and a pain to get anything out of. Ultimately none of this massively affected my stay, its just not up to the standard I expect from them.\n\nThe one other thing to note is that if you book for a couple of nights but turn up a day later than arranged for instance, then your booking gets automatically cancelled. This happened to my mate and caused a right headache after a long day working. The staff were lovely and helpful and explained that the room was refunded, however we had to pay for another room.\n\nThe hotel has a huge car park and the Brewers Fayre is just a hundred yards away.\nThere is also free wifi. \nI recommend paying for the meal deal as the hot breakfast is buffet style so you can determine your own portions.
