The charm and attentiveness of the hosts Carol and  Chris has been well documented and their charm and professionalism shines. You do need a car in this part of the world and then the world is your oyster (well this part of the uk certainly is...)

But I reiterate, we paid \u00A3100 per night and for this area was probably about right fo the standard of accommodation. The balcony overlooked the car park and I didn\u2019t feel safe being out there.

Our standard room was extremely small and rather bland-so we negotiated an upgrade to the Tower Suite which was splendid.The double bathroom was beautiful and the four poster bed was really what you would expect in such a lovely hotel.The spa was smart but so busy that we were unable to all 4 of us find loungers by the pool( but the staff said it was not usually this busy).My husband had a sports massage which he said really was fantastic.\nWe were all a little disappointed in the slightly patchy service over dinner-some long gaps waiting for little things such as tea at the end of our meal and on several occasions we all had empty glasses and had to pour our own wine-hardly a hardship but not really what you expect from a top class hotel.The food was good quality but a litle lacking the wow factor. The cheese board however was fantastic- a very wide selection of well thought out local and regional cheese and avery good portion of each was served.\nOur main gripe was the charge for tea which was frequently offered - on arrival,as a wake uo and in the lounge after breakfast. The charge of \u00A36 per cup seems exceptionally steep particularly when there is no facility in the room to make a cup of tea and when they are charging \u00A3330 for a tiny room with no breakfast it was generally felt that tea should be complimentary. To make matters worse we spotted on our bill after paying that they'd charged us for an extra 3 cups (\u00A324) which we hadn't had.

The welcome from reception was superb with a discreet but professional manner.  We were escorted not only to our room, but were given a short tour of the public areas so that we knew where to go.  Our room was lovely, just the right size, with comfortable arm chairs and a bathroom that while not huge, was adequate.  The view over the gardens to the side was tranquility itself.  The room was furnished with antique furniture - so much nicer that the corporate makeover so often used now.  Our bags were already in the room, so none of that unfortunate hanging around of the porter for his tip!\nDinner in the Park Restaurant was simply perfect.  We had the gourmet tasting menu and accompanied it with the wines chosen for the menu by the sommelier.  The range of ingredients used was impressive from sweetbreads, to turbot, veal, venison, fois gras, mango, peas (in a Panna Cotta), passion fruit, amazing cheeses and so on.  Each dish beautifully presented, perfectly proportioned and with flavous put together by someone who really is at the top of his game. This meal had been preceded by champagne and the most exquisite canapes in the Drawing Room (where my room key was discreetly whisked away and then given back on departing the restaurant, as the waiter had observed that I was not carrying a bag).  The service easily matched the food - being extremely professional but friendly with none of the starch or snootiness which so often is found in equivalent establishments.\nThe spa attached to the hotel is second to none.  Extremely efficient staff in a simply superb setting with excellent facilities.\nIf I have a criticism it is that the brasserie attached to the spa was a little lacking in warmth from the staff.  While I appreciate that this is meant to be more informal dining you are still in an exclusive establishment and I was a little surprised to be ignored when we entered.  However, the mixed platter of nibbles that we had as an early lunch was again superb.\nOther reviewers have commented that the place needs  smartening up.  Well maybe.  The paint on our windowsill was definitely due for renewal but I would rather have the odd bit of flaking paint if it means that the attention to detail inside the hotel is of this standard.  Yes, \u00A36.00 for morning tea is, I suppose pricey, but it came with a delighful home made muffin and a pain aux raisons and was leaf tea served in a silver pot etc.  What a lovely way to start a day!\nMy daughter said that she felt as though she was staying in a house from Pride and Prejudice which believe me, is a great compliment!  There is all the warmth of staying with friends with the absolute bliss of being looked with true courtesy and professionalism.\nBeing under an hour from where we live, I suspect I may have developed a rather expensive habit with Lucknam Park!",5,positive

Again great chat with staff about menu versus tasting menu, then the paired wines choices. We did tasting menu with standard wine matching, and I'm totally sold on letting a quality knowledgable establishment like this have their sommelier pair wines for you. its really, really nice having different wines throughout a meal, especially ones that go perfectly with what you're eating.

Lucknam Park offers traditional, refined luxury and has very peaceful atmosphere, perhaps too peaceful for us travelling with an 8 yr old and 14 yr old although it is advertised as family friendly.  The rooms are a little dated and it shows in the bathrooms most of all. Not having a fridge was also annoying although you can request one, welcome chocolates and grapes were provided but not tea or coffee. \n\nWe had to have two adjoining rooms due to my son being over 12 but this did not work out too well although the extra bathroom was useful the room set up meant that we had to pass through an area with an open glass door to get to each other\u2019s rooms (not much privacy) and also the light in the central area could not be turned off at night but we could not shut the doors as my 8 year old would have been scared and the doors locked behind you.\n\n Anyhow the grounds were beautiful, really ornate gardens and the Brasserie had a relaxed contemporary atmosphere. The food that we had for dinner, and in particular breakfast was very good and fresh a few items were not available at breakfast no waffles and no chocolate croissants which was a shame for the children, service can be slow, allow 1 hour for breakfast. \n\nWithout a doubt the best feature was the spa pool and sauna rooms, these were very impressive and we spent half a day here, the children were welcome but we did feel the need to remind them to be quiet for the sake of others as it was a relaxing atmosphere. The outdoor pool area was also well used due to the great weather, I was surprised that there did not seem to be a drinks service outside and there was no outdoor area for the children to use as one pool was a hydro pool and one the spa guest pool.\n\nMy daughter loved seeing all the horses and borrowing bikes to ride around on, we were given a carrot to give to the horse but another member of staff then asked my daughter not to feed the horses ( a bit contradictory).

My relative asked if we could have more tea, and we were additionally charged (did receive new cups and more tea was served) however when i paid the bill there was a discrenpancy with the bill which was eventually sorted out by the hotel.",3,negative

The hotel's setting is superb -  once you are through the fabulous wrought iron gates, the driveway is a ten-minute affair, lined either side with magnificent and imposing trees, at the end of which you find the house. The staff are very obliging, and do their utmost to make every aspect of your stay as enjoyable as possible. \n\nThe spa building has been sympathetically designed to remain in-keeping with this Georgian stately home, yet the complex itself is the height of modernity. What is more, even on a blisteringly-hot August weekend, it was not overly crowded; there were plenty of sun-loungers, and the indoor\u002Foutdoor hydrotherapy pool meant you could make the most of the weather. The brasserie bar and restaurant, which adjoin the spa, is a great place to enjoy a light lunch and the obligatory afternoon\u002Fevening drink before dinner.\n\nOn our previous visit, our room was in the main house. This time, we had one of the courtyard rooms, in the former coach house building. The room was very well appointed, extremely spacious and with plenty of light. The gardens are also well-tended and awash with colour.\n\nMy only criticisms are extremely minor, and did not impinge at all on our enjoyment: the TV only received about half of the normal Freeview channels, and the hotel's DVD collection did not seem to include many of the more recent blockbuster releases (I had particularly hoped to watch The Iron Lady).\n\nAll in all, an exceptionally relaxing place just a short drive down the M4.",5,positive

As you enter the estate you're greeted by the horses which they have on site. \nUpon arriving I was given a tour of the hotel by the duty manager, something which many 5 star hotels don't do. Full compliments to him by the way. He was very helpful in choosing a local restaurant\u002Fpub to eat in on our first night and assisted in planning which attractions to visit.\nOn a second morning we went horse riding. I consider it expensive but it is well worth it with the hotel's extensive grounds. The instructor who took us out was fantastic. (I can't remember her name but she was French, so thanks to her).\nThe spa is extensive with a japenese salt room and amethyst room in addition to the steam room and sauna. It is also very clean and modern but the sun chairs outside are badly placed for late afternoon sun - chop down those trees! \nThe Park restaurant is superb and unfaultable. You must eat here during your stay. \nThe Brasserie where we ate lunch though is to be missed. The staff are fantastic but the food is overpriced for what it is. As a manager of a pizzeria, I can safely say that their pizza (which we had to start) was very undercooked and the dough far too heavy. The sausages and mash were nothing out of the ordinary and the portion size of the fish of the day was small for the price.\nThe room was clean and had everything expected including a half bottle of welcoming champagne, although I would consider modernising the bathrooms.",5,positive

11.43\ca\1096373\245503\139850501.html,Lucknam Park,"""I needed to find a quiet relaxing Spa for my wife's birthday. One thing that always disappoints me about a lot of hotels that call themselves 'spa' is that the term is used very loosely. When you're paying to stay somewhere, you want it to have more facilities that your local gym.\nI found Lucknam Park and was immediately drawn to the new Spa building that they had built, which looked beautiful in the pictures, it did not disappoint in real life. It had various types of steam rooms (saline, amethyst) as well as an indoor\u002Foutdoor therapy pool and something that I consider to be essential, those high powered jets by the side of the pool that massage your head and shoulders. The pool itself was a good size for a swim, and the glass ceiling made it feel very spacious. Outside there was an Italian style terrace for sun bathing (and we were lucky with the weather). The changing rooms were beautifully designed and used a lot of dark wood and glass. There was also another salt steam room off the changing room.\nAll in all this is a great sized spa with great facilities. We've stayed at larger spas like Pennyhill park, but it gets very busy (as does the hotel\u002Frestaurant), what we loved here was that the hotel only has about 30 rooms (I think, might be more) so it feels very exclusive and not at all crowded. Also the attention to detail and service throughout was great. It's the best genuine \""spa\"" we've been to in the UK. And they do do those treatments, if that's what you want too!\nAt the other end of the new building was a brasserie restaurant which has stunning 3m tall folding doors that open onto a large Lavender edge patio. We sat there in our spa towels (because we could) enjoying a healthy lunch, to the bemusement of the ladies who lunch who had gathered there.\nOur room was in the main country house with an incomparable view straight down the avenue of Limes. Both my wife and I really liked the style, a fusion of classic antique with fresh contemporary colours.\nDinner in the main restaurant was good. A highlight was seeing TV Masterchef Greg eating a few tables away. \nOther highlights included the grounds where we went horse riding one afternoon across the 500 acres with a guide (very much recommended). There is also a large children's play area (but we hadn't brought ours)",5,positive
11.43\ca\1096373\245503\140897744.html,Lucknam Park,"""My partner and I stayed at this hotel for our anniversary back in August. It all started so well. The drive along the beautiful road to the hotel, the look of the hotel and being greeted on arrival and them parking our car for us. Perfect start.\n\nWe were then shown to our free upgrade room? Free upgrade to a deluxe suite apparently. On entering the room, we found a worm on the bathroom floor and a beetle in the clothes cupboard. The room was small, but did have nice views of the ground. For a deluxe room, it didn't even have a  separate shower, only shower attached to the bath taps. As requested, they kindly gave us a fridge, which certainly had seen better days and didn't get that cold.\n\nWe then went to the spa for the day, early. When we arrived it was lovely and peaceful, perfect. Nice spa, good rooms, all going so well. We then went to the restaurant around 2.30 pm and looked at the evening menu (as my partner is Gluten-free and we were told to tell the chef if there's anything we need from the menu, to be made gluten-free). At about 3pm, we asked the waiter if the Wood-baked pizza (as a starter) could be made gluten-free for our eve. meal booked at 8.30 pm. She went and asked the chef and he said he did not have enough time to make some gluten-free dough! 5 and a half hours, not enough time? I make pizza's (incl. gluten-free and it takes approx. 30 minutes to make a simple dough and you don't have to leave it to rise like normal pizza dough). When we expressed our dissatisfaction at the end of our stay, the Manager said \""Usually we say yes to our guests before we even know what the request is\"". Not this time though, funny that.\n\nWe then ventured back to the Spa and finished the afternoon, with screaming kids in the pool (it was like a public swimming pool) not a relaxing, tranquil 5-star spa that we expected (I guess it depends on what time of the day you go) so be warned. Oh and we asked if we could use the salt pool, only to be told that the salt pool is only available to guests who pay for treatments, where does it say this on the website?\n\nThat evening we went for our pizza-less meal. We asked the staff (as we were on the \""Brasserie Treat\"" package) what dishes were included in the package, only to be told \""just order what you want and we will charge you for whatever isn't included\"". Sorry? So the waitress did not know what the package included. Another waitress kindly clarified after, that the package included all dishes on the menu. Despite this, I must say the food was delicious.\n\nThe next day, we had breakfast which was very nice (apart from the dead insects by the wall, which had not been hoovered up) and checked out and went back to the Spa. When swimming in the pool, we picked up a good handful of loose (what appeared to be glass) small square tiles floating on the bed of the pool. Also, there was a leaking water machine which had spilled water all over the floor (near the Ameythst room). The workers who usually pop through the pool, to remove the water from around the pool (made by people splashing and to stop people falling over and cracking their head open), had not spotted this and many times we nearly fell over. I had to tell a member of staff to hurry up and clear it up. In the late morning it started filling up with kids again and the noise levels increased. Time to go, so much for a tranquil 5-star spa!\n\nWe also played tennis after that, which we were really looking forward to. We were given raquets with virtually no grip (5-star quality?), and balls that were so hairy they hardly bounced!\n\nWhen we left, we spoke to the Manager about all our concerns. He kindly listened and seemed to take everything on board. Although he did question whether I had personally picked all the swimming pool tiles out of the pool?) I don't usually carry a tool to remove swimming pool tiles with me when I swim and did not appreciate being questioned about this. We were told that we would be written a letter of apology and and our concerns would be taken up. Here I am about a month and a half later and still no letter. When I called, there wasn't even a letter in the post so once you're out the door.......... \n\nIn my opinion, this is no where near a 5-star hotel. So many things just not right and that could easily have been right. Shame, as the grounds and the look of the hotel are amazing.",2,negative

The building and grounds are magnificent, but even more important is the way they treat their guests. The staff was omnipresent yet unobtrusive, which is a wonderful quality, and made us feel like guests in a friend's home rather than customers in a hotel.   When pulled up in our car -- bleary-eyed after a long and tiring journey -- and walked into the lobby to register, by the time we were done our car had already been parked and our luggage placed in our room.  Like magic.  And when we ordered drinks or afternoon tea in the lounge, no-one asked our name or presented a bill to sign; they knew who we were and the charges just appeared on our bill.  Like magic.  What a welcoming way to treat guests.  At a Four Seasons, there would have been forms to fill out, bills to sign, claim checks to save (and probably a liability waiver to execute).  Staying at Lucknam Park is like spending a weekend at the home of in-laws you actually enjoy visiting.  I can't recommend this hotel enough, for the building, the grounds, the magnificent food at The Park restaurant (which easily deserves its Michelin star), the dramatic spa, and most of all for the impeccable service provided by the professionals who work there.",5,positive

We booked a deluxe room and the package included dinner in their Brasserie - the Park (michelin star) restaurant is not open on a Monday evening unfortunately. We arrived around 2pm and check in was quick and easy and very personal, sat on the comfy sofas rather than at a typical check in desk. Our room wasn't quite ready, which was fine so we had a quick tour of the hotel and then we were shown to our room. They had given us an upgrade to a Park suite (in the courtyard) which had a lovely four poster bed and a large sofa and chairs. The bathroom was well fitted out with a bath and a separate shower with a lovely large shower head. Plenty of soft white towels on the heated towel rails and lots of nice smelling toiletries, plus two nice bathrobes. They had also given us a bottle of champagne and some chocolates as they knew were we newly married. The bed was perfect, not too hard and not too soft with lovely bedding. The room had a large built in wardrobe with a safe and slippers. No tea and coffee facilities though. TV with freeview and a dvd player, dvd's are available to borrow at reception, we didn't borrow so not sure of selection. \nWe had booked two massages in the spa and the staff were very welcoming - news had travelled around the hotel that we were newly weds and they gave us the couples treatment room. They had a spa offer on which they were happy for me to take advantage of and swap my pre-booked massage for. Good treatments, very relaxing and professional therapists. We spent the afternoon chilling in the gorgeous spa using all the facilities. \nDinner was booked for 8:30pm and we had some drinks first in the lounge area. The service was a little slow at times but we weren't in a rush. Dinner was delicious, lots of choice and we both left feeling really quite stuffed! \nBreakfast is served in the brasserie or the Park restaurant. We opted to have it in the Park Restaurant and it was lovely, again the staff were aware that we were newly weds and all came over to offer their congratulations. I had a lovely berry smoothie and we both had pancakes with maple syrup and bacon, sinful but yummy! there was a selection of yoghurts and cereals plus they bring toast and drinks. \nAfter breakfast we had a walk around the grounds before checking out and returning to reality. Check out was smooth and they helped us to the car with our luggage. \nIt was a lovely short break away and I would recommend to friends and family.

Arriving on a wet autumn afternoon, several cars had been left in the driveway in front of the main doors so we had to stop 50 yards away (and later reverse out down the drive past more parked cars).  As there were no staff around to assist with the luggage we had to wrestle the bags through the rain into reception ourselves.  This has never happened at Castle Combe or Whately.  Check-in was then efficient but there was a minor maintenance problem with our room so we opted for tea in the lounge while a new room was made ready.  It then took over half an hour for simple tea and coffee to arrive.  Perhaps the staff were busy hosting a meeting that appeared to be going on elsewhere in the hotel but this did not give a good first impression.\n\nHowever, from then on things improved immeasurably.  When it eventually came ready, our replacement room was a suite at the front of the main house with a much better view and much better amenities.  We were also not charged for the tea and coffee we had while waiting.  Dinner then fully restored faith in Lucknam's reputation.  We were with a group of around 75 people being hosted by a local business.  Despite having to bring out each course near simultaneously for this large group the food could not have been better if the Chef had been catering for just the 2 of us.  Flavour, texture and presentation were fully up to Michelin standard and the staff were brilliantly attentive and efficient.  In the morning, breakfast was equally delicious, good ingredients well prepared and presented.  My only disappointment personally was that despite having a dozen or so varieties of tea to choose from, Lucknam is another Michelin-starred establishment that only offers a single generic coffee, and not a particularly good one at that.  There is good coffee out there and it is possible to prepare and present it to a standard to match the food, and without a major cost delta, especially at the price point these hotels operate at.  If our local bistro can do it, so can you!\n\nNevertheless, we came away very impressed with Lucknam, with dinner a real highlight.

Everything was \""just so\"" healthy portions, linen table cloth on the coffee table when it was served an discrete but attentive service.

We were very much looking forward to our stay given the excellent service we received during booking. The location is very pretty. The drive through the gardens to the main house is quite special. We were warmly greeted, checked-in and and shown to our rooms. \n\nThe rooms themselves have a nice homely feeling but lacked the finesse and extras that would be expected of a hotel of this standing. This included lack of Wi-Fi and no mini bar. The room decoration seemed somewhat tired. The bathrooms were lovely with nice toiletries however we found the water coming from the shower to be luke warm at best. Overall we were not impressed by the rooms.\n\nWe had breakfast and dinner in the Brasserie where we received excellent serive. We all thought the menu had an extensive offering. The ambience was lovely, as was the food.\n\nWe did not use the Spa facilities as it wasn't that kind of break but we did have a look and it seemed very nice indeed! I can see why other reviewers speak so highly of these facilities. \n\nOverall I would only recommend this hotel and spa to make use of the many facilities it offers.

Upon arrival you drive up a very long driveway which has speed humps on it except they are not marked on the drive and can (and did) catch you out.  There are signs on the grass but you don't really look at them for concentrating on the drive.  Lucknam Park is set in 500 acres of beautiful countryside and the hotel itself from what we saw was very welcoming, warm and  almost home from home.  We sat in a living room area and there was an open fire and large sofa's and traditional furnishings. It was very cosy and relaxing and peaceful.  Our tea was booked from 3pm but we had to wait at least 25 minutes before anything was brought out to us.  When it arrived is was beautifully presented.  Having experienced many afternoon tea's in other establishments you tend to compare.  At \u00A323.50 per head I didn't think it was the best value for money with only 3 finger sandwiches each, one was salmon, there was ham and tomato and a tiny roll filled with egg mayonnaise.  You had the usual fruit and plain scones with clotted cream and jam and a slice of what we think was coffee cake and then the usual fancy patisserie on the top tier which did look stunning.  Quality and taste of the food was very good.  There was no further offer of replenishing the sandwiches etc only the tea which was unusual.  Having had afternoon tea at the Manor House in Castle Coombe I personally would say that was much better value for money and food was replenished if you wanted it plus the patisserie were in my opinion much nicer and more cake like.  I cannot fault the hotel and the surroundings and would return for a cup of tea in the summer and for a walk around the grounds as its really beautiful and so peaceful but I wouldn't return for afternoon tea again and would rather go to Castle Coombe.",4,positive

But this was the first time I had attended the Cookery School - and it won't be the last! I spent two consecutive days getting to grips with Indian food: West of Indian cuisine followed by Indian Street food. Each day covered six to eight dishes; the steps and skills required were demonstrated to the class by the chef, Hrishikesh Desai, and we were then let loose in the amazing kitchens. These are fabulously equipped and beyond luxurious - but what made the days so valuable was Kesh's expertise and enthusiasm - he is clearly passionate about food and teaching, and his enthusiasm is catching! His assistant Sarah worked tirelessly to ensure we never ran out of clean equipment, and both were always on hand to answer questions or help with a tricky technique. We stopped several times each day to sample the completed recipes, and all were absolutely delicious.\nHowever, the real proof of a cookery course is whether you can recreate the recipes at home. Thanks to the skills learnt and the detailed recipe notes, I have just wowed my family with a five dish Indian feast - and my daughter and I have booked our places on the Seasonal Vegetarian Course. Can't wait!",5,positive

We ate in the Brasserie where there is a wide range of dishes, beautifully prepared and presented. The spar is again of very high standard. Whilst the hotel stay was expensive it was exactly as we expected and worth every penny.\nThe cookery school is in a separate house on the estate a short way fro the main house. Established some six months ago, it runs a range of gourmet cookery courses of a day or half day content. The school has been newly designed and built throughout and is equipped with high quality furnishings and equipment. Whilst a keen cook, my skills are embryonic and I had worried that much of the teaching would be out of my league. The Head Chef and primary tutor Kesh was marvellous as were his assistant Sarah and support Lewis. We were shown how to prepare three high quality courses not only by demonstration but by continuous assistance and support throughout the day. I repeated the menu at home the following weekend and although the meal was not executed with the same panache, the diners were appreciative.\nI can thoroughly recommend this cookery school to all aspiring cooks. I will certainly return for some of the other courses. I also consider it to be very good value.",5,positive

From the moment you arrive you're welcomed with first class service & treatment from the staff. They come out to you, park your car, take your luggage straight to your room & give you a guided tour of the hotel. The hotel's architecture & decor is simply divine, it is full if history & character. & the grounds are kept immaculate & so are the rooms. I was highly surprised with the level of cleanliness - the cleaners do a fabulous job & leave your room spotless in the morning & at turn down. The Spa at Lucknam Park is simply breathtaking! The best Spa I've ever been to definitely! It's everything you need and more - there's a big pool, a hydrotherapy pool, saunas, steam rooms, a fitness studio a relaxation room which you're taken to after having treatments, where you can spend as much time relaxing as you wish whilst sipping a fruit tea & eating strawberries! Me and my friend had a beauty treatment everyday which were all FABULOUS! Especially the Firming & Toning Body Wrap which is almost like a 4 in one; Salt exfoliation, Sea weed clay & wrap, head massage & what felt like a mini little facial, priced at \u00A3190 it's worth every bit of money & the treatment does last 2 hours. \n\nDining at Lucknam Park is wonderful. The Park restaurant is the more formal restaurant & of course Michelin Star. We dined here on the first night & was blown away by not only the amazing \u002F top notch food, but the quality of service. You're treated like royalty!

The whole experience was very special, our room was luxurious and very comfortable with probably one of the best beds we have ever slept in.\nWe enjoyed the Gourmet Menu.  The quality and presentation of each course was second to none, the knowledge and advice of the Sommelier was impressive. Service smooth and unobtrusive, giving a calm and warm atmosphere. \nThe following morning, we took advantage of the wonderful spa facilities followed by a stroll around the elegant and extensive grounds.\nWe shall return.",5,positive

Fabulous surroundings in the middle of nowhere, a long drive up to the \""country house\"" that really does make you feel like you are about to enter a period drama.

The spa and brasserie are tasteful, modern new additions to the rear of the main part of the hotel and the bedrooms are spacious, warm and quaintly romantically english. The food was exceptional and the service sublime.  If you want a real treat or want to spoil someone rotten, this venue should be high on your list.",4,positive

The Brasserie is casual and potentially enjoyable however it was noisy to due to children with parents who failed to notice they were not the only diners!\nThe courtyard standard rooms were cosy and inviting.\nThe Library and Drawing room were relaxing public areas with (generally) good service for tea and drinks.\nOverall, the reputation of the hotel is deserved.

As a simple thing, it is always a pleasure (for me at least) when the staff remember your name and seem genuinely pleased to help\u002Fguide you.\n\nThe rooms are a little small in comparison with some competitors, but just about everything else is faultless. The spa is among the best I've seen and the food in the main restaurant is of a very high standard. Having said that, the more casual Brasserie was also very good indeed. \n\nWe were warned that there would be too much food as part of the Christmas package and that was true.While this is a minor issue, it was almost ridiculous to have a package that included afternoon tea served almost straight after a three course lunch on Christmas Day and then segued into another 3 course dinner.

As a treat Chef had prepared a birthday cake and one of the waitresses (Laura) had decorated a plate with birthday messages. We were also so impressed by how one of the other waitresses (Esther) cared for an elderly diner who was not well: amazing customer care and on a very busy Saturday night service.\n\nOn Sunday we had room service breakfast which again is done so well; the food is as fresh\u002F hot as if served in the restaurant and it was set up perfectly on a linen tablecloth on a table looking down the tree-lined drive. \n\nThis was then followed by a morning in the leisure club and spa indulging in the wonderful treatments.

The rooms were delightful - old fashioned but in a most charming way - with all the services one would expect (good wifi, TV, good shower etc). The spa was just fantastic.  My mum and sister booked a couple of treatments, I enjoyed the gym and we all enjoyed the indoor outdoor pool.  The food was excellent - the main restaurant was outstanding for our set piece dinner and we had an amazing fine dining experience.

We were upgraded to a deluxe room and the extra space does make a difference.  We dined one night in the main restaurant and one night in the Brasserie;  both were excellent with the former being more formal and serving excellent Michelin star quality cuisine.  A nice touch is that we couldn't finish our bottle of wine the first evening so it was saved for us for the next night, but just another example of the hotel's attitude.  Breakfast is very good but not exceptional (and I fully admit that this is really nit-picking but such is the level of the bar that the rest of the hotel sets).

It\u2019s like Downton Abbey without any pretension, although Mr. Darcy (Pride and Prejudice)  would have been at home in the grand drawing room and library.\nWhat make this place so special is not only its elegance, plush comforts, vast  grounds, a pool and hydro-spa that even a non-pool person can\u2019t leave, AND exquisite food -  it is undoubtedly the staff.     From the moment you grace the long driveway and step foot in the grand front door, all needs, (even those you don\u2019t know exist) are  met.   Peter made us most welcome at check-in - which was more like arriving to stay with friends. He and others continued to look for discreet opportunities to make our stay more meaningful.

The rehearsal dinner was extremely well done.  It was a large group and we required two rooms, but they were staffed to handle us and our meals arrived promptly \""on time\"" if you will.

So, too, were the breakfasts in the morning -- ranging from light \""continental\"" to a choice of full-fledged English breakfasts.  We had a lovely room overlooking one of the many gardens close to the premises.  We were blown away by the Beech Tree lined entry road.  Most were planted in the the mid-18th Century.

It seems as though every detail was thought of, from the beautiful and plush interior design, to the pristinely maintained hotel grounds. The gardens that are full of roses and other colorful flowers make you feel like you are in a fairy tale. I can definitely see why this hotel is one of the top destinations for weddings. \n\nThe rooms were spotlessly clean and the interior design truly brought out that \""British Countryside\"" charm. The four poster bed was comfortable and the highlight was waking up in the morning and opening the window to a wonderful view of the gardens and to the unspoilt countryside air. No request was too little or too big for the hotel staff who always made us welcome. The bottle of champagne, chocolates, and strawberries in our room upon arrival was also very much appreciated! On a side note, the deluxe rooms don't come with tea and coffee facilities but we rang up the reception and this was quickly organised! Every morning we could have freshly brewed coffee\u002Ftea in our room.\n\nIf you choose to stay here I strongly urge you to try the Park Restaurant. The food and service are of true Michelin star quality and my vegetarian diet was incredibly well catered for. Also, it is definitely worth getting a recommendation for a wine, as the wine list is very extensive. At the recommendation of our Ma\u00EEtre D we went for a smooth French ros\u00E9 and it went beautifully with the food.\n\nWe had breakfast at the Park Restaurant and the waitress that served us was so wonderful, polite and professional!  She had a lot of knowledge and made us feel very comfortable. We enjoyed it so much that we came back to the Park Restaurant for breakfast for the entirety of our stay. The quality and freshness of the food was second to none and everything was delicious.\n\nThere are so many positive things to say about this hotel but I feel that one of the most important ones to mention is the Spa. The therapists are probably one of the most experienced professionals I have ever met. I was lucky enough to have quite a few treatments but one that truly stood out was KUNDALINI.

The hotel is a real gem set in peaceful surroundings and with great food and spa (including a hotel pool you can actually swim in). It also has a cookery school, equestrian centre and wellness facility (yoga etc.) so lots to do if you're so inclined.\n\nOur room was ready on arrival which was pre the allotted check-in time and there was no hesitation in checking us in. We stayed in Hydrangea overlooking the courtyard. The room was great, not huge but with fantastic beds and linen and a non-hotel feel as though you've pitched up at a friend's country house for the weekend. Welcome chocolates were swiftly delivered and they organised a tea tray for us, free of charge. A nice touch as there is no tea and coffee in the rooms. \n\nWe headed over to the Brasserie for lunch and I must say, by then it was late in the lunch service and the whole place was a bit of a mess with tables left uncleared and lots of small children making a din. Not the best start to our relaxing spa stay. The food was great, as always, but the service was slow and whilst there were plenty of staff working, it was as though their attention was elsewhere and they couldn't see the mess for themselves. We left as quickly as we could and changed into our robes ready for our spa treatments. It was a warm sunny day so we were able to relax outside and dip in and out of the main pool and hydrotherapy pool to cool off. Children are only allowed to use the pool at certain times and that rule did seem to be enforced. Our treatments were sublime, and it's those that keep me returning. I've not had better, more professional treatments anywhere in the world. Do try the herbal back therapy - it is a bit special!\n\nDinner in the Brasserie that evening was much better and we had a fabulous meal which was part of our package. The food is really excellent but I was a bit disappointed that we couldn't eat in our robes after 6pm. It is a spa restaurant after all but I can understand that other diners might not like it. If you're on a spa stay though, you don't really want to change out of a swimsuit, have dinner and then change back again if you are intending to make use of the spa facilities which remain open until 10pm. My advice is to book a late dinner so that you can use the facilities for as long as possible before changing.\n\nWe had a great night's sleep and then had a lovely breakfast in The Park restaurant. After a walk around the grounds and a look at the mares and foals we decided to spend the afternoon with magazines in the library before enjoying a magnificent afternoon tea in the drawing room, rounding off our overnight stay nicely.\n\nI will definitely return but in the past I've visited in winter during the week and there have never been any small children about. If you're keen to avoid them, think carefully about weekends and school holidays as the hotel does cater to families and that is slightly at odds with a relaxing spa escape if that's what you've booked. There is no doubting the facilities, the dining and the service are second to none though and we definitely did not want to leave!",5,positive

Spa was excellent - new, outdoor heated pool, lots of choice, great sauna and steam room. Lots of loungers and toiletries. Lovely gardens. main grounds- massive, horse riding archery and clay pigeon available. That said, didn't do clay pigeon as was quoted \u00A3227 for 2 ppl! Not worth it at all. Beautiful surroundings. Food\u002Fdrink - great wine selection. Brasserie- stunning food if avoid their steak. We didn't have it but didn't look that good. Starters and mains top marks and typical fine dining level. Halibut was the best my partner has ever had and out did the red mullet on the park Michelin restaurant menu. Also dined in the park - 6 course taster menu \u00A3105, was very high standard of food and enjoyed by all. Was not worth the money as having dined in a number of Michelin and none Michelin restaurants for a lot less in price we felt the food was over priced but very tasty and nicely presented. Was just not enough of what was given. Good cheese selection. Dining room could do with a little spruce but excellent dining service especially as they were hugely accommodating with their menu choices- we substituted a couple on the taster menu to accommodate our tastes. Service generally - their biggest let down across our two night stay. Just a general delay with most things particularly with any small requests. Some lack of interest from some staff and didn't really feel it was to the standard if a luxurious stay. Also saw what appeared to be a member of staff barging into the wrong room in error with room service without knocking. Didn't bother us but would have the ppl inside! Room- sadly a huge disappointment as stayed in the ivy standard room-pokey and not great decor although cosy. Comfy bed I must say especially the bedding. Nice view of gardens. But no place really to comfortably sit to have room service. Bathroom could barely get two ppl in at one time. Shower was great and was functional but not to the standard you expect given the cost of the room. Wall paper also peeling off as not well ventilated. Was clean though. Biggest issue -noise. Room on a corner of a corridor, staff and guests woke us each morning at 8am onwards. Hardly slept. Not relaxing at all. No tea\u002Fcoffee making facilities which is annoying and highly unusual. Basically avoid this room. Complimentary chocs strawberry and champagne was nice in the room. Despite the room, noise and over priced bit we still thoroughly enjoyed our stay as the rest outweighed the bad generally. Those who stay at similar places regularly may be disappointed unless they get a food rate\u002Froom.",4,positive

The rooms were very small and the kids' room only had a small double bed which couldn't convert into twins. We really wanted twin beds for the kids, vainly hoping they'd sleep better if not kicking each other. They moved us but the rooms didn't interconnect, and the doors automatically lock when closed, resulting in the 4 year old going for a wander at 4am to find our room and getting locked out of his own room, stuck in the hallway. They also forgot to mention that our new rooms were directly above the kitchen so incredibly noisy until the kitchen closes. Why they didn't think that was relevant when we have two little kids in tow is beyond me. They had no other room options so we stayed put and dealt with the noise. The kids loved the pool but it was really an adults' area - supposed to be peaceful and quiet. And we were asked to leave the hydrotherapy pool, despite the kids being very quiet and well-behaved, as they have a blanket ban on children in it. The hydrotherapy pool was bath temperature, very appealing to kids and just too tempting for all the younger guests - we saw many of them in there right in front of the pool attendants but we had the misfortune of being there when a rather officious attendant was lighting the fire behind the pool and he demanded we get out. Felt too embarrassed and humiliated to get in again after he'd left, even on my own without any kids. Spa treatments were excellent, food at The Brasserie was pretty good (incl. children's menu), staff mostly helpful. Quite annoyed to receive a phone call to our room at 7am on first morning, waking us up after quite a tough night with the kids - nobody seemed to be able to explain it or to care enough to look into it. Also annoyed that they had no baby listening service. If we wanted to pop down to the restaurant for dinner when the kids were asleep, the only option was to pay for a nanny to come, minimum 3 hours ar \u00A330 per hour - extortionate!!! Or leave the kids alone, which we weren't prepared to do. I really don't regard this hotel to be family friendly as billed, more like tolerant of children if required.",3,negative

She was very welcoming, wished me happy birthday and couldn't do enough for us. \n\nHaving had a tour of the magical grounds, we arrived at our room for the night. We were greeted with a bottle of champign, strawberries, a birthday card and beautiful chocolates. The room was fantastic and with amazing views of the manicured gardens on both sides of the room. \n\nWe had or supper and breakfast in the bestro which was very pleasant and fantastic food. Staff were very friendly and very attentative. My only complaint would have been how loud the chief was. With an open kitchen you would hope he could keep the shouting to a minimum while to only two diners eat breakfast in peace. \n\nThe spa was very luxurious, clean and tranquil. We were very lucky with the weather as we were able to spend most of the day on a sun lounger. \n\nSpa treatments were wonderful and everyone very pleasant. \n\nWe had a wonder round the equestrian centre and I was very impressed! \n\nAll in all by far the best birthday surprise and highly recommend this location!",5,positive

We had afternoon tea included as we booked our stay through Smith Hotels, had we have paid for it I would have been disappointed. However, just to be clear, there was nothing negative to say about the afternoon tea...I've just had better.\n\nThis is probably my favourite hotel in England and I'd strongly recommend it to anyone!

It was our 10th wedding anniversary and it was everything we could have wished for and more.  From the magnificent drive to the main house, the wonderfully warm greeting and the attentive but discrete attention to every need it was all perfect.  Our room (Geranium) overlooked the grounds and with a lovely sash window we could see miles around us and not another building in sight (all from the comfort of a beautiful four poster bed).  My husband had booked a \u2018made to measure\u2019 massage which was a perfect start to the stay and also champagne and flowers for the room.  There was also a complimentary bottle from the Management which was a lovely touch for our anniversary.  After a rest, and later on, we dined in The Park restaurant.  It was simply superb.  We opted to upgrade to the 7 course gourmet taster menu and also had the Wine Pairing menu.  The food was delicious and the wine, simply divine.  The service was, once again, attentive yet discrete.  Nothing was too much trouble.  The Sommelier was very engaging with his explanations of the wines and it complimented each course perfectly.  Breakfast the next morning was served in your choice of the Brasserie or the Park Restaurant.  The choice on the breakfast menu was varied from a traditional full English to either fish, haddock, omelette, continental breakfast or Eggs Benedict of your choice.  \n\nWe had a wonderful time and would highly recommend this to anyone wanting a special night and day away.",5,positive

Our room was small but very quaint, well equipped (apart from a kettle - more later!) and very comfortable. The chocolates, strawberries and personal note are a lovely touch.\n\nThe brasserie, in my opinion needs some work. The food is good but not great. The staff are good but not great. They work really hard but just don't seem very organised. The prices are in my opinion very erratic. I had calamari for a lunch starter which was very good and well priced at \u00A38. I then had a langoustine salad starter for dinner at for 2 little pieces it was \u00A320! Wine is always expensive in hotels but I do think \u00A38 for a small glass is excessive. That said the main course was very good and good value - just my point - erratic!\n\nOne genuine point of complaint. We were asked if we would like tea in our room in the morning. Very nice I thought until I saw the bill - \u00A313! Either tell us there is a charge or don't offer it in a way that suggests it is complimentary - its gently misleading and leaves a slightly sour taste.\n\nOverall, very good but I would say that at \u00A3300 per night you can afford to give me a cuppa!",4,positive

It took us a few minutes drive just to go from the main gate to the actual hotel buildings. The landscape was breath-taking and well-maintained yet without losing the wildness of nature. \n\nThe staff was warm and welcoming. My mother sprained her leg the night before so she had trouble walking. The hotel unfortunately didn\u2019t have wheelchairs available but they assured us that our room was on the ground level so my mum didn\u2019t have to climb stairs.\n\nWe had a Park Room overlooking the courtyard. The room was spacious enough for two and the bathroom was immaculate. We ordered dinner and breakfast in the room and I couldn\u2019t rate highly enough of the delivery staff. They were polite and thoughtful, nothing was too much trouble. For dinner, my mother had vegetable soup and grilled prawns and I had salad and wild mushroom risotto. The food was delicious.\n\nThe spa was another highlight, swimming pool and various steam rooms were opened till 10pm. We were free to wander in wearing a dressing gown. It was quite busy when I had a peek in the afternoon but by the evening it was a lot quieter. I had the steam rooms all for myself :) We have had a pretty stressful day having to cope with my mum\u2019s leg problem and then missed our train subsequently, but by the time I got out of the spa I was new person. We both booked for a full body treatment for the following morning.\n\nWe had dinner the next night at the 1 Michelin star restaurant in the estate. Me being a vegan, the chef prepared special dishes for me. They were excellent, but I have to admit that I was left slightly peckish afterwards (ha\u2026) since the dishes were mostly made with light vegetable and salad ingredients. However, the dinning room was lovely and it was a pleasant evening.\n\nDue to my mum\u2019s walking problem, we couldn\u2019t wander very far. So I ventured and asked the reception whether they could drive us around the estate with a golf buggy I spotted parked outside the hotel. Without hesitation, they arranged someone to pick us up outside our room. Our driver turned out to be wonderful chap from Portugal who gave us a delightful tour around the gardens and buildings and talked us through the history associated with them. He was patient enough to stop at various spots where we wanted to take photos. My mum was very happy (to get out of the room!) and I was thoroughly impressed and grateful.\n\nMy mother liked the place so much that we extended our stay for another night.\n\nI could go on, but my point is that this is what services is all about.

Champagne on ice,   magazines, soft lighting, wonderfully comfortable bed top quality sheets, a hand written card from the manager welcoming us, all created an atmosphere of luxury and gave me a glowing sense of well being . The pool at the Spa is one of the most beautiful I have experienced and the treatment I had with Tanya was sublime.  Dinner , in the main dining room ,and service were excellent ,the staff all seemed to know that I was celebrating my birthday and continually made it festive. We stayed there for three nights over Easter. On Sunday my grandchildren and their parents joined us for  lunch at the brasserie, this was the one area were the service was poor.   Waiting time for our order was far too long, to be fair the restaurant was full to capacity ,and I really hate to be critical as everything else was so good. This area definitely needs a bit of work to keep up to the standard offered in the rest of the hotel.

The rooms are decorated in old country house style and although are not too shabby are reminiscent of a '90's country house style decor. Although the hotel touts itself as child friendly and indeed children are offered a very warm welcome from the staff with activity packs left in rooms, the main communal areas are hushed and formal. The main restaurant (I have eaten there on two separate occasions pre and post children) has been a real disappointment each time in terms of quality of food and most recently incredibly slow service. I am not quite sure how they maintain their Michelin star. \nSo you are probably wondering why I have rated it so highly, well quite simply it is set in stunning surroundings, is the best child friendly hotel close to Bath (unless you manage to secure a reservation at Soho House) and the modern spa with its inside out pool will take your breath away. In fact that whole side of the hotel complex, the spa and brasserie is incredibly well run, and high tech. Children can use most of the facilities but swim times for children are a little too limited for my liking. I appreciate that there needs to be an adult only time but to make children's swim times so limited and early in the day when most are having breakfast does need reviewing if you want to tout yourself as a family friendly hotel. \nIn short, if you are looking for a traditional English luxury getaway and are post 50 then this could be the perfect place for you.",4,positive

As it was a special anniversary trip, we decided to splurge.  Lucknam Park is the definition of \""getting what you pay for!\""  The drive up to the hotel will take your breath away and when you step into the lobby you know you are in for a treat.  There is no detail undone.  From the vases of flowers from their gardens to the Wellies you can borrow for walking around the property, the lobby itself will give you a taste of what's to come.  We booked a King Park room and when we walked in to it, I was speechless.  The room was so elegant (canopied bed, beautiful furniture and artwork), but the view really took my breath away.  Our room looked out over the lavender maze and across the extensive parkland.  There was a box of chocolates, a bowl of fruit, and a bottle of champagne waiting on us.  The bathroom was not to be believed and the huge soaking claw-foot tub was just what I needed to get rid of jet lag.  We didn't dine in The Park restaurant for dinner, though with a Michelin star I'm sure it's wonderful.  We did dine at the Brasserie and it was fantastic.  Our server, Stephen, was charming and funny and his service was impeccable.  We each had a massage in the spa and wished we could've spent more time there.  The pool and sauna areas were very nice.  Our rate included a fantastic breakfast in The Park restaurant and also included a walking tour of the property followed by tea.  This was a true highlight.  Andrew, the estate manager, gave us an amazing tour of the extensive gardens, equestrian center, and restaurant gardens.  His knowledge was impressive and he was eager to answer questions both about the gardens and gardening in general.  I wrote down many of his thoughts to bring home.  The tea that followed in the drawing room was elegant and delicious.\n\nThis location is excellent for sightseeing, though you will want to make some good blocks of time to just enjoy the hotel.  Take time to sit and read in the Library with a drink at night, or to stroll the property.  You will need a car, unless you choose to arrive by helicopter!  We rented a car at Heathrow and drove straight to Lucknam  after stopping at Stonehenge.  Be aware that you will need a GPS\u002FSatNav to find it and for Americans who are used to driving on the other side of the road and car, it can be a little tricky to head off onto these tiny roads.

Lucknam Park truly is a country house hotel, just intimate enough to feel at home whichever part of the house you're in.

Nothing was too much trouble for him.\nWe had a small room and bathroom which was fine but nothing at all special and was a  cheaper room but it looked out to beautiful views of the lavender and grounds. It was where everyone seemed to stand though to smoke or make cell phone calls so check you are not naked with the curtain up.\nWe ate at the Michelin restaurant and thought that the food was delicious and fresh and inventive and I think we as a couple just don't enjoy the fine dining experience. We Love the food but the service is just so over the top attentive and we prefer to eat and have conversation than have a waiter and staff performance of filling up the bottles and constantly asking if we were enjoying ourselves and the meal. We made a joke and counted 30\ntimes  different staff asked \""are you enjoying it\"" they are all lovely but it's just too much and feels a little dated and ridiculous. However am sure some people love this attentive service. We just thought we would love to not constantly be interrupted by the staff. \nBreakfast in the same room next morning was also a stuffy ambiance. All very hushed dulcet tones and unrelaxed so after that we had room service breakfast the next day.\nWe loved the spa area and found it a beautiful in and out door  pool area and great in every way from saunas and steams to changing area. We both had a good spa treatment which was a massage each. We both thought they were fine and were happy but not blown away by any means. Some massages can be life changing in terms of relaxing and so on and these were nice but no more than that. \nWhen it was hot and sunny we wanted to sit outside and all the sun beds outside were taken so we asked staff if they could bring some of the many beds from indoors to the grass outside and they did but with incredibly pained expressions and they had to find out if this was possible. So that is the only complaint. We had lunch at the brasserie but weren't into returning there for dinner as it felt a bit sterile so went for dinner in bath which was great. I really recommend the Mint Room a delicious top notch Indian for those up for something else. \nMy tip to the hotel is ask spa staff to be a bit more accommodating to guests and perhaps ask them to do the fine dining without all the outdated drama, and you will keep the younger clients, wanting to return again and again,  just as happy as the American tourists that lap that all up!\nThis is a spa hotel that really does have a homely feel and is in truly beautiful grounds and I think that if I didn't  travel\nas much I wouldn't notice any faults but the faults were more to do with us not enjoying fine dining service, picking up on the odd points mentioned above and otherwise this hotel really is wonderful and although it is very expensive I would happily return & I would recommend this to friends and family who especially want an old fashioned British experience.",5,positive

It is so close to a 5* but it misses out by getting details wrong - which is the difference between a stress-free stay and a bit of hassle.\nFor example, the rooms are lovely but the wardrobe is the tiniest I have seen. We were two in a room for three nights and we could not hang up all our clothes (and you tend to have nice ones with The Park restaurant a must-dine venue!) - we maxed out at 6 hangers and the rest had to stay in the case. There's no mini bar. There's no coffee\u002Ftea making facilities. There was no breakfast menu card. Side tables were not wiped down during the daily housekeeping. They offer a shoe shine service but do not collect or shine the shoes. The inroom TV is pretty dated but the entertainment systems are quite good (inc smartTV).\nAfter a quiet request everything was provided, but you feel like you are on the phone to reception for the first day being a pain! \nOutside there are signs of maintenance being required - flaking paint from both windows and garden door in the room we were in. In a way it's homely, but in another it knocks the score needed for 5* in my opinion.\nFor such a place I would say the Brasseries wine or gin lists are that good really. There is not much adventure in either so a longer stay would lead to boredom if you like trying a variety of things. Unfortunately, that attention to detail kicks in again when our Hendriks Gin was served with lime - again corrected after a polite request.\nBreakfasts are extensive and enjoyable. However, when we requested it in our room, that little 'service devil' struck again with no spoon for the cereal, no granulated sugar for cornflakes, no salt.\nThe staff are lovely. The grounds are well kept and you can imagine it looking glorious at some times of the year although it has to be said they are still a sight to behold in our grim Autumn.\nSo nearly there, but not quite up to the Relais & Chateaux standard I have experienced before. Well worth going and whilst it sounds silly it's well above 4*, and on their packages it is quite good value as a 'claimed' 5*. But if you paid full price you might feel a bit disappointed that it's not quite the 'proper' 5* it could easily be.",4,positive

They also have many rules in many rooms you are not allowed to use for wedding because of hotel guests.

We planned to have our wedding in the Lavender Garden and on our wedding day there was a large white marquee on the side view of the garden !

Might be the best hotel room in England I have stayed in. The truffles and fruits and card was an extra added touch that we appreciated very much. \n\nDinner was nice, I wouldn't go for just the restaurant personally as I felt it lacked character but the food was to a good standard. Breakfast on the other hand was marvellous and so was the wonderful lady who served us (didnt catch her name) but she made us feel so welcome and is a credit to the hotel. \n\nI would recommend this hotel to everyone and anyone it is perfect in every aspect and I do not believe there is anything the staff will not do to make your stay as wonderful as possible. \n\nThank you lucknam park and we will definitely be back :) ",5,positive

The grounds and hotel are absolutely gorgeous and well kept.\n\nThe Spa Therapists were amazing, great service and the massage was to die for! We had a couple massage and both therapists talked us through the treatments and really made us feel valued and welcome. Unfortunately the massages were that good I have forgot the ladies names but they both deserved recognition by the hotel. \n\nThe spa itself was well maintained and very clean!\n\nI would also like to say that the restaurant \u002F brasserie manager who served us our lunch, deserves this job just for his customer service level. Very impressive and Lucknam Park have a very good member of staff there!\n\nThe negatives.\n\nWhen we arrived at the Spa reception we were waiting about 15-20 mins to be greeted. We couldn\u2019t see any staff! Did not feel warm and welcoming.\n\nThe bar staff \u002F waitress who served us our coffee and pastries really felt lost and made us feel like we were putting her out! Would have been nice if there had not been a 15 minute wait between getting coffee and pastries. Or at least would have liked to have been offered another coffee to actually go with them, (wouldn\u2019t have even minded having to pay for a second coffee)\n\nThe lockers in the Spa were touch and go. Some of the buttons didn\u2019t work as well as they could therefore making it hard to enter pins correctly.\n\nThe electric door in the swimming pool did not work and people had to manually push it open if they wanted to get outside.\n\nThe view from outside pool was amazing but I would have removed the parasols wrapped in tarpaulin. A bit of an eye sore.\n\nWould have been nice to have had somewhere that we could go during the day at the spa for another tea \u002F coffee break in robes instead of having to get changed to enter brasserie. Ideally would have liked an option to have by pool but even another room would have sufficed.\n\nFelt lunch menu was lacking. A choice of 2 items per course is not enough. Would say that the food we got was good but forgettable. Whilst restaurant manager was good, it would have been nice to know how much a supplement we would have to pay for anything on the menu. In hindsight we probably should have asked. However I think if you are offering lunch as part of your spa day then maybe either don\u2019t restrict the menu to 2 items for 2\u002F3 courses, or give an allowance so each person could have an allowance of x amount towards their lunch and then pay for any cost over that allowance.\n\nAs a whole we thought it was a good  day but I think the issue with the lunch menu did not warrant the \u00A3165 price tag per person for a spa day.",3,negative

We booked a Park Room which was on the ground floor which was great for us as we had our dog with us. They provide food, bowls, leads, beds, blankets and towels for pets plus a toy and treats. The hotel is set in 500 acres so we had plenty of nice walks. The welcome on arrival is superb as the car was parked for us and luggage taken to our room - the reception rooms in the hotel are lovely and the hotel dining room is beautiful - it used to be the Ballroom. We ate in the Michelin starred restaurant - the food was divine. Although the hotel was very busy the service was excellent. You can also eat in the Brasserie which is less formal. The hotel has a spa and we made use of the pool, sauna and steam room. There is a hot pool where you can swim outside also. This 5 star hotel is not cheap but I guess you get what you pay for - it is elegant and beautiful without being stuffy and unfriendly. It certainly has a great vibe in the bar and restaurant  having recently stayed somewhere that was practically empty it does make a difference to your stay. I would put it in my top 5 hotels in the UK and would definitely revisit ",5,positive
11.43\ca\1096373\245503\553419114.html,Lucknam Park,"""Lucknam Park has a lot going for it and my wife and I have visited a total of four times now so thought it was about time to write a review based on our experiences which have been pretty consistent with each visit. \n\nFirstly the history is fascinating, at the start of the war, the house was home to hundreds of evacuees before being transformed into an informal headquarters for airmen from the neighbouring aerodrome. They used the Beech and Lime tree driveway to park Spitfire and Hurricane planes \u2013 The huge trees being a perfect camouflage.\n\nSecondly is the food. Sadly we have never had the chance to eat in the Hywel Jones restaurant as it's opening times have never coincided with our stay dates. But, we have eaten many times in The Brasserie where the food, service, ambience and value for money has been excellent. It is great to see chefs working in the open kitchen and nothing is to much trouble to make, even if its not on the menu in an effort to keep people like me with Celiac or my wife being vegetarian happy. We have even frequented The Brasserie when not staying at the hotel.\n\nThe rooms have always been warm clean and tidy and the staff have always been friendly and helpful. Sometimes you are offered an extra evening at a heavy discount which is nice. The house and grounds are well worth a look around as the gardens, decor and furniture is well in keeping. There is a comfortable lounge to relax in too.\n\nThe spa and pool area is great and a good place to have a dip, chill out with a book or just have a snooze. The only small criticism if there was one is the quality of the spa treatments. A 60min massage is over \u00A3100 and a 90min one is near on \u00A3150. For these prices I really do expect high end treatments but sadly neither of us have never had a treatment at Lucknam Park that has made us say Wow!!\n\nNext time we go there when funds allow, I think don't think we will bother with spa treatments but fully intend to make the most of the hotel, we might even get the chance to try out the Restaurant Hywel Jones by Lucknam Park.. Lets hope so.",4,positive

However, on our last stay for our 10 year wedding anniversary we were left bitterly dissatisfied.  \n\nOn check in we were told that we had a lovely upgraded room. This was not in fact true. We complained that we had been put in a room with staining on the carpet and broken patio doors.  The receptionist told us that we had not in fact been upgraded. I have no issue with not being upgraded but I don\u2019t appreciate being lied to. The receptionist said she would deal with it. We went to the spa and never heard from her. After 3 hours, we phoned her and she told us we could move to the room next door. It was the same category of room but had been renovated and was absolutely lovely. \n\nWe went for breakfast the next day which was no longer in the Brasserie but the main dining room. We ordered toast which never arrived. We chased it up but is still never came.\n\nWe then went horse riding. My horse was playing up but the stables staff reassured me that he was just greedy and wanted to eat another horses hay.  \n\nWe went out for a walk around the estate and I told our guide that my husband wasn\u2019t experienced on a horse and therefore I didn\u2019t want to do more than walking or trotting.  \n\nI also mentioned that my horse seemed agitated.\n\nThe instructor assured me that the horses are extremely well trained and never misbehave.  As soon as she said that, my horse went from trotting into trying to buck me and galloped across the field. My husbands horse then took off with him galloping. I am an experienced horse rider so I managed to stay on the horse but I was extremely shaken. Thank goodness my husband also managed to hang on to his horse.\n\nWe walked back to the riding school, with our legs like jelly.  I do not blame the hotel or the the riding school for the behaviour of the horses. What was upsetting was that no one followed up with us, not even one phone call to check that we were ok after it was clear we were very shaken up.\n\nFinally, on check out we called and asked for help with our luggage. No one came to help us.\n\nI wrote a lengthy letter to the manager of the hotel as I had absolutely loved the hotel and I didn\u2019t want to write a negative review of it without giving them the chance to respond to my guest feedback form.  I handed in that feedback in October and I am still waiting for any response from the hotel. This shows me that they clearly don\u2019t value feedback or the guest experience. \n\nIt\u2019s such a shame because this really was one of the top hotels in the UK.  \n\nI will add that the meals in the Brasserie and the main restaurant were exceptionally good.  We also enjoyed a spa treatment that was very good.",3,negative

Lucknam Park is simply awesome. One could never fail to be hugely impressed by the grandeur of the main hotel building, set as it is amongst hundreds of acres of beautiful countryside and flanked by its own cookery school and equine centre. \n\nThe service was first class; attentive, professional, polite and personal. Nothing was too much trouble and the staff had that wonderful ability to preempt requests before you had to ask - always a sign of a top establishment. \n\nThe spa facilities are beautiful and superbly appointed. Our room, a classic, was small but perfectly appointed, cosy, clean and warm. The hotel's interior is hugely impressive, grand and classically opulent. The library, dining room and drawing room all add to the stately charm of this beautiful estate. \n\nWe dined in the brasserie which was excellent and we particularly enjoyed the open kitchen and watching the chefs hard at work. The food, drink and service were all excellent. \n\nBreakfast was served with panache and professionalism and the quality of food was superb. We both agreed that the eggs, in particular, were some of the nicest we had ever tasted. \n\nWe couldn't fault anything about our stay. Being my birthday it was even more special and memorable and for all of the above reasons we will return without doubt. \n\nThank you to all the staff for making our stay so fantastic.",5,positive

We started out at the amazing equestrian centre where we were made to feel very welcome - nothing was too much trouble for the girls and we were soon kitted out with appropriate head and footwear. When booking this experience I explained that I was both disabled and had not ridden for decades, so requested a laid-back and smallish horse. They gave me a choice of two and could not have been more helpful and understanding. I was very nervous at first but thanks to Oscar and Kiri our lovely instructor, my love of horses and riding has now been re-kindled and I can't wait to go again! This was followed by lunch in The Brasserie - the lads were attentive and service superb - the leek and blue cheese soup was to die for as was my companion's dessert. The afternoon was spent in the beautiful surroundings of the spa and we particularly enjoyed the outside hydrotherapy pool. All in all a great experience and one we cannot wait to repeat later in the year.

The restaurants are reviewed separately in detail \n\nWe have just returned home from a wonderful 2 night stay. The staff and the service are truly exceptional. From the welcome as we pulled up, the valet parking, the check-in and the tour of the facilities to the service we received in every single department of the hotel, spa and both restaurants was warm welcoming and of a very high standard. We were made to feel special and relaxed. The setting, and the environment in which it sits makes it a perfect place to relax, unwind and indulge yourselves. There are two restaurants here. The main Michelin star one and The Brasserie. We had some issues with the food in the main restaurant, very mediocre, tasteless and unimaginative for a Michelin star eatery at dinner on the Friday. We faired much better in the Brasserie in terms of quality and value for money. \n\nThe Hotel and Spa were simply outstanding in terms of comfort and the services provided.  The Spa is in a separate building, a very short walk via the main inner courtyards and walled garden, from the main house however it was only approx 20 metres from our room to the Spa building, the same one that houses the Brasserie restaurant.  The room we had was of a very generous size with huge extremely comfortable bed and very large bathroom.  It was located in what appeared to be in a old converted stable block with only had 4 rooms in it.  With the hot weather we had the windows open at night, it was so peaceful, nothing to hear; no traffic or people noise.\n\nThe Spa is only open to hotel guests and spa members so no day visitors or worse hen parties, all was very quite.  We found a lounger each by the pool at approx 0930, it wasn't until after 11 that anyone else came in.  It did get busier in the afternoon, however no more than half a dozen other couples and thankfully no kids.  \n\nThe facilities available are superb and comfortable. Enormous fluffy towels and robes in abundance and replaced regularly without the need to ask through out the day.  the two treatments I had were marvellous with each therapist an expert; a 60min flotation wrap and a 90 min 3-phase massage.  wonderful experiences both of them. \n\nWe will definitely visit here again without hesitation, however our expectations of the culinary experience will be down graded and restricted perhaps to The Brasserie",5,positive

However myself & a friend were left very disappointed. Everything was fine up until the point where our food & drinks were served. My friend is vegetarian & so had previously phoned up weeks prior to inform them of this & she was served 2 boring plain egg sandwiches & when she asked the waitress if there were any other options she informed us that the chef had forgot & so she would see what she could do, 5 minutes later she brought out some avocado sandwiches, why couldn\u2019t they have done that in the first place? It just seemed like they wanted to put in as minimal effort as possible to try to keep us happy. As well as this, when she went to serve our drinks, the teapots she had brought with her were empty & she had forgotten the jam & cream for our scones. At this point it was practically comical & so the waitress went off again for 5 minutes & brought back some teapots actually filled with something! Over the time we spent there we noticed we were not the only ones who were unhappy with the food & service & also watched many of the waiting staff make multiple errors all at different tables. Overall not the kind of standard I was expecting from what appeared to be a lovely country park hotel.

The breakfast is superb and the staff everywhere very attentive and friendly in the main. \n\nThe spa is nice (although some areas looked a little tired and were out of order) with a nice warm (but not too warm for swimming), big pool and we had a wonderful massage which I can highly recommend.  It's a shame there are not better views from the outdoor jacuzzi as I think with a little alteration there could be a nice view from there too, rather than just looking at a patch of grass.  There's a lovely little salt water pool which we used but the area around it seems not to be looked after, it's in an odd position and we didn't see anyone else use it which is a shame. \n\nWe ate in Hywel Jones restaurant on our first night and enjoyed his signature tasting menu with wine pairing and it was outstanding.  Very deserving of his michelin star and this is so worth a visit whether a guest or not.  The wine also was delicious and innovative and the sommelier was engaging and incredibly knowledgeable.  We ate in the brasserie the second night and that too was of a very high standard and we enjoyed it immensely, again with friendly, attentive staff.\n\nThe setting is magnifient both the grounds of the hotel and the area itself.

The hotel is set deep within the green and pleasant Wiltshire countryside and, although not far from the M4, it feels a world away.\nThe check in is carried out very smoothly with the car parked and bags to the room within a few minutes. Then up to the room to settle in. Room number 7 - we were apparently upgraded from the standard to the a garden room, lucky us. Nice room - traditionally furnished and decorated, good size, modern ensuite and lovely views over the grounds to fields beyond. So, if like me you like trees, there are some beauties to wonder at and you'll be very happy.\nLater we make our way downstairs to the lounge for our aperitifs. I enjoyed my Negroni cocktail and my wife her glass of white wine. The Negroni was \u00A316 and, having just spent a couple of weeks in Sicily where I knocked back many a good Negroni at 5 euros a hit, I could only but wonder at Sterling's demise.\nWe were then ushered into the dining room. Large, spacious and light, like Jane Austen's favourite ballroom, with windows affording views of the gardens it was a fitting venue for a Michelin meal. The food was lovely - a crabby starter followed by tender venison, succulent and beautifully prepared. Pud was creme brulle with rhubarb and ginger doughnuts. My wife had sea bass and the cheese from the trolley to finish off with. The young lady who presented the trolley gave a fulsome description of each of the cheeses and won a round of applause from one of the diners.\nThe food is beautifully presented and the service good.

It's a great place to spend a relaxing weekend, forget you worries and to be generally pampered. If your budget is as long as the M4, it's well worth a visit.",4,positive

The approach up the tree lined drive adds to your engagement with the period property. All the staff were very attentive, friendly and happy to help with whatever you needed. We stayed in one of the main house rooms which was fantastic and when we were greeted by a cold bottle of fizz and personal card for my wifes birthday it added that little something extra. We headed straight for the spa and relaxed by the pool and hot tub (indoor and out door) for the rest of the day which was fantastic and just what we needed. We decided to eat at the brasserie rather than the main restaurant because we wanted something a little more relaxed. The food delivered what you would expect from a 5* property and the staff made every effort to ensure we had a good night. The beds are the most comfortable you'll find and the quite setting ensures you really escape. Breakfast this morning was in the main restaurant and although this was the formal dinning room the mood was relaxed but the staff were very attentive throughout and we had a mixture of the continental and cooked which hit the spot.

The greeting at the reception was not the warmest, as the staff bustled around us and finally found the time to check us in. We mentioned we were on our honeymoon however the receptionist appeared disinterested. Fine. We were led to our room which was also fine but what I would describe as dreary and slightly dated. \n\nWe walked down to the reception to enquire as to what activities we could do (i.e. clay pigeon shooting, horse back riding) and the person at reception looked surprised we had asked and then had to go away and ask another member of staff what was on offer. The second member of staff mentioned the clay pigeon shooting was circa \u00A3300 which felt unreasonable, and then when I enquired as to the horse riding started reciting technical terms at me which, having not really tried it before (who knows if there was a beginners lesson?), we decided to decline also. \n\nDeciding that it was probably going to be all too hard to do an activity we wandered to the Brasserie. The Brasserie described itself as modern, but I would say it is also dated. It was a few hours before dinner so the only light bites on offer were some sandwiches which were average and more or less stale. We wandered back to our room and got ready for dinner. The dinner at the Brasserie was nice enough and they provided a glass of bubbly on the house to congratulate us on our marriage. \n\nThe next day, despite being underwhelmed, we thought a morning at the spa would lift our spirits. The photos on the website looked amazing so we had high hopes. When we got there a lot of the areas were closed off. There was scaffolding, the outside area was closed, the hot tub didn't work, there was rubble everywhere and to top everything off there was noisy construction taking place - needless to say I was very annoyed that we hadn't been told this. We obviously would have gone somewhere else if we knew this would happen. I said something to the spa reception and they acknowledged that the place was under construction and that they would see what they could do, but then did nothing. \n\nWe went for afternoon tea which was pleasant enough however there were flies buzzing everywhere in the room (one was hanging from the roof - I should have taken a picture), the staff who served us the afternoon tea however were very sweet.\n\nThe next day when we checked out, the reception staff asked if we had a nice stay and we said no, because the spa was in a state (the main reason we came to Lucknam Park) and they again acknowledged that there was construction but again offered nothing in terms of a discount or even an apology! As stated, It was our honeymoon, we would have gone somewhere else. I would also mention there was a service charge attached to everything (including drinks\u002Fsnacks ordered at the bar and not part of the restaurant) so I guess the hotel made there money back on any gratuities provided to us (i.e. the bubbly).\n\nIn summary, the experience wasn't pleasant and I was unhappy by the lack of interest (borderline rudeness) from a lot (not all) the staff. Customer service is such an easy thing to get right, yet they got it wrong. The Spa was not nice (see pictures - not like the photos on the website). Obviously I would not recommend this hotel, and I am surprised by some of the good reviews I have seen.",2,negative

There are some great reviews on TA (along with a few not so great ones) and on paper the hotel looked perfect for a birthday celebration at a quintessential country house hotel. Regarding those positive reviews......I think I must have been in a parallel universe.\nOur arrival was a bit chaotic and not especially welcoming but it was quite busy.\nWe took refuge in the library while we waited for our afternoon tea. The public rooms are lovely and we\u2019re especially so given the Christmas decorations were still up.  We had our afternoon tea which was fine and then went for a wander across to the Spa and a look at the Brasserie which again was all good.\nWe were shown to our room which was freezing cold and we were advised that there had been a problem with the boiler.  It took a while to warm up because the heating hadn\u2019t been turned on, there was no problem with the boiler. \nThe room was small but fine.  There was a birthday card for my husband which was nice.\nLater we went across to The Brasserie and was served by a lovely waitress for drinks.\nThat\u2019s the ok stuff out of the way.......we had a mediocre meal in The Brasserie, the menu was limited and my meal was not good.  I appreciate that the Hywel Jones restaurant is the star as they always are in R&C hotels but having waded through December, Christmas and New Year my husband and I just wanted a good flavour full uncomplicated meal, which should be a given in a hotel such as Lucknam Park.  We waited for over 15 minutes for our bill, and despite assurances it was coming, it didn\u2019t and we eventually made our way to the till to be told by the manager they couldn\u2019t find us.  He pulled up the guest list and straight away we saw our name, so we were able to settle our bill.\nWe returned to our room, passing cleaning equipment, laundry and plastic bags containing rubbish (a constant throughout our stay).\nWe went for breakfast the next morning which we were really looking forward to as it was to be my husbands Birthday breakfast.  There were a number of empty tables that hadn\u2019t been reset and we were told there were tables available in the family room adjacent.  I have no issue with children, having quite a few of my own but I don\u2019t want to spend breakfast stepping over children who have toys, paper and crayons strewn across the floor. We were asked to wait and there was someone else waiting to be seated before us, we duly started to head off out to the family room\u002Fwaiting room when a man wandered past me and said to the waitress \u2018I\u2019ll take that table\u2019 and promptly sat down.\nAs I was trying to process what was happening on auto pilot I went and did as I was told and sat down in the family area.  As reality dawned I spoke with the restaurant manager to clarify why the above had happened only to be advised that the gentleman needed a table for 3 and was waiting to be joined by other members his family.  No warmth, no smile and very clearly annoyed by me.\nAfter waiting a further 10 minutes with the lady and daughter in front of us still not being called through we decided not to bother.\nWe spoke with the manager and he agreed that the service had not been good and adjusted our bill.  That was not what this was about for us, we would have been very happy to pay if we\u2019d had a great time.  \nIn summary; not great and sadly will not return which is a real shame but on a positive note, now safely ensconced at the Lygon Arms....warm room, larger room, tea, coffee and biscuits in room, beautiful hotel, open fires, great service, buzzy atmosphere, Veuve Clicquot and chocolates in room and breakfast included all for \u00A360 less......lovely!\n",2,negative

For a 5 Star country house I was surprised that the basic room was \u00A3300 per night which seemed cheap compared the competition but the reasons for this were soon obvious.\n\nOne fantastic thing about the hotel was the staff and their friendliness. Hats off to them, they were great. We were greeted at our car with a smile and you made us feel very welcome..\n\nThe room however was old and dated and the carpets had stains. I can only liken it to my grandmothers spare room. The bed was small and far too soft, dipped in the middle and I didn\u2019t sleep well and woke with a stiff back. Old and dated decor made the room not a very nice place to relax and we removed ourselves from it as soon as we arrived in search of somewhere to relax. The hallway to the room had creaking floors, cream walls and carpets which seemed to be a theme in the hotel and again the floor was dirty and stained.\n\nWe wanted to relax next to a fire but The lounge area was being used for afternoon tea. We looked in and there were 5 elderly ladies enjoying their teas and we then knew we were in the wrong hotel for a young couples weekend away. We really had nowhere to go and the weather meant we had to stay inside. This made us feel a bit trapped and we even looked at availability in nearby hotels but we were out of luck as this was the only 5 star with availability...... this says a lot.\n\nWe are in our late 20s and early 30s and we were easily the youngest people in the hotel by 10years and we felt this even more in the dinning room that evening. \n\nThe food in the restaurant was as expected for a Michelin Star rated restaurant but the setting was energy sapping and dull. Old carpeted floors, soft lighting in an already dark room and everything is a shade or cream. \n\nThe spa is highly rated but we arrived to find no room for us to lie down, we resorted to getting into the water and waiting for someone to leave. When we eventually found a bed to relax there were kids playing in the pool loudly for two hours so it was very far from the relaxing spa day we envisaged.  I don\u2019t understand how this spa is so well rated as I found it similar to any indoor pool surrounded with beds . \n\nFood in the brasserie next to the spa was tasteless. We had pizza and the dough was raw in the crust and something anyone could cook in their kitchen without a thought.  It was also empty for lunch which worried us and added to the feeling of being trapped.\n\nThis is a very subjective review I know but I would suggest that the hotel is not for young couples looking for a country house.

The best massage I\u2019ve ever had. Ask for Sue and have a back and shoulder massage. Make sure you visit on one of the three days she works.\n\nThe gardens are huge and very well kept. For Fitbit users the walk from the hotel just down the drive gives a return trip of nearly 3,000 steps. Engrossing watching dozens of squirrels (grey unfortunately) and lots of horses. In early evening there are deer to be seen.\n\nOur room in the rectangular old \u2018stable yard\u2019 was relatively small but comfortable. The bed was excellent and pillows were good. Lots of hot water, very large fluffy towels and nice bath products. Reasonable WiFi.\n\nThe downside seems to be around the somewhat haphazard front of house organisation which many other guests record. Very nice, well meaning staff but communication between them could be better. Having booked in, and knowing we were relatively early, we gave our luggage away, and took coffee in the lounge. We explained that we were booked in with family for afternoon tea. Two hours passed and we asked three different people what time our room would be ready. Throughout that time we overheard three guests gently complaining to reception that things they had arranged hadn\u2019t happened. We never got an answer to our query so went a walk. We were approached twice subsequently to book in, by different people. \n\nWhen our family arrived to join us things got even more muddled. We eventually were shown to our room to find our luggage already there waiting for us. No one seemed to be responsible for ensuring we were shown our room when it was ready.\n\nThe lounge areas were all set for afternoon tea so we weren\u2019t sure where residents would sit in bad weather. \n\nThe kitchen provided me with a delicious birthday cake and we enjoyed sitting in the garden in the sun to eat it.\n\nSunday was Mother\u2019s day which was very busy and popular with non residents. \n\nWe were incredibly spoiled by our family for this special weekend, and it was very special indeed.

As a five star hotel you expect the management and staff to be at the top of their game. Certainly, restaurant Hywel Jones attains this, with superbly cooked and presented food, although the restaurant itself is quite antiquated and lacks soul. \n\nHowever, there are areas where the five star service slips. On our first evening, we were surprised not to receive a turn down. We mentioned this to reception on the following day, who were surprised and said they would mention it to housekeeping. Once again, on our second evening, no turn down. The following morning we asked to speak to the manager before going into breakfast. Even after checking out no one approached us so again we asked to speak to the manager. The duty manager arrived and said he'd received the message that we wanted to speak to him. So why did we have to ask twice? He told us the missed turn downs were because we had our do not disturb sign up at the time that housekeeping wanted to do the turn down. Although they should have known at what time we would be out of the room, as we were eating in the hotel, if they couldn't do the turn down at a time suitable to them, then we wouldn't get a turn down. And there was me thinking that things would be organised at the paying customers convenience, and not to fit in with housekeepings own schedule. Additionally when we got home my wife thought she may have left her sunglasses behind, so phoned to be told that housekeeping would call us the next day to let us know if they had turned up. Guess what. No one phoned!. This all sounds very picky but it's not the fact that the turn down wasn't done or that no one called when they said they would, it's the fact that no one seems interested in making sure a 5 star hotel provides 5 star service.\n\nThe other thing that surprised us was that none of the door handles in the room were properly fixed! All the screws were loose as though someone had taken them off to paint the doors but not bothered tightening them up. Very strange.\n\nWe saw the General Manager wandering about the hotel a couple of times, but he seemed to have no interaction with the guests. Perhaps if he spoke to his guests he could get feedback in a more personal manner. It has certainly been our experience in other quality hotels in the UK that GMs like to speak to guests of their hotel.\n\nWe will no doubt be back at Lucknam in the future as we really liked the hotel. However, it needs to improve to get back to the same levels as other five star hotels in the West Country.",4,positive

We had spa treatments planned and the most amazing Horse ride through the estate. We had Afternoon Tea in the drawing room several times which was beyond delicious. We ate dinner in the Brassiere and though it considered the casual dining option the food was fabulous. We met some lovely Londoners staying for a weekend getaway in the Library one evening.

We were most impressed with the newly renovated Spa and pool which featured a swim out jacuzzi (the size of a small pool) to a beautiful sunken private garden.

No space for anything, there was not even space for toiletries to be left by the sink area. The room resembled a medium range b&b, Shower over the bath was difficult to use and although seemed recently decorated was not cleaned to the highest standard, this was the same in the stair area to the rooms, full of leaves which I accept is nature but this should be cleaned at least once a day surely. I also found it surprising large laundry bags left outside in the courtyard for hours, not third world problems I accept but shabby for any hotel. An earlier reviewer mentioned having to use the kettle on the floor, we had no such tea facilities. Finally the room was unbearably hot even opening both windows, and it was not too hot outside. We called for a fan and had a tower fan bought to the room, it was noisy, dusty and so old David Dickinson would have been thrilled. Irony when we raised the issue at reception we received an apology and were told they have Dyson units, shame we never got one.\n\nPool area split into 2 zones one for those having had treatments. We spent about 3 hours in the afternoon enjoying the sun and lovely pool. However, dirty plates and glasses left on a number of tables with no guests remained there attracting flies.\n\nThe Brasserie restaurant has the atmosphere I imagine similar to that on the moon. The food is fairly basic and just ok, basic cooking errors with the cooking (including burnt caramel on the sticky toffee pud, a sin in anyone\u2019s book). The service is slow and ambience sterile. We sat at the bar the following day and the bar staff were cheerful and very efficient.\n\nBar service in the main bar was slow, staff pleasant enough, quality of drinks good but having to try and get someone\u2019s attention when you have had an empty glass for a good time is again not acceptable in an R and C hotel.\n\nThe hotel is stunning, however in need of some repair to the outside woodwork, in the rooms and public areas.\n\nFinally, staff were in the main professional and charming however more than a few were somewhat surly or miserable.\n\nIn the main it seems a lack of management overseeing the running of the place and standards are clearly far below what they should be.\n\nSo very disappointing.",2,negative

Love that our instructors pushed us a bit, too, so our riding and confidence have also improved - thank you!\nWe  spent plenty of time in the spa as well  - the pool(s) and surrounding gardens are lovely.

The member of staff I spoke to about it was a little patronising, informing me that \""it's an old building so they do get hot..\"" - actually, not necessarily - my own house is almost 200 years old and is beautifully cool in the summer (without air conditioning), if you air it at the right time of day and so on.\n\nAlso, the breakfast offer is satisfactory, but not outstanding -  I've had much better breakfasts at more modest hotels. (Perhaps this is a British phenomenon, as the breakfasts we had staying at Chewton Glen last year were similarly disappointing!). A shame, as a great breakfast is always a highlight of any hotel for me, and something I really look forward to.\n\nPS: I greatly appreciated the well-timed turn-down service, and my youngest daughter was very pleased with the little personal touch arranging her teddy and the gift of a toy pony: thank you!",4,positive

The hotel is beautiful and has a really nice atmosphere and the staff were friendly and attentive. We had a garden room looking over the estate and it was very good. Nice size, comfortable bed and a great view. \n\nIt poured with rain on the Saturday but the lounge was a relaxing and beautiful place to play board games in front of the fire. We treated ourselves to afternoon tea which was top notch. \n\nWe had dinner at the main restaurant on Saturday night and it was marvellous. The food was exquisite and the new restaurant manager was great and made us feel so at home. We have eaten at a lot of Michelin star restaurants but were really impressed. \n\nI set the hotel staff the difficult task of catering for a pregnant woman with a nut allergy. They dealt with it perfectly and had no trouble making adjustments in my food. \n\nThe spa was very nice and we really enjoyed our spa treatments. Our only comment is that if the pool\u002Fsauna area is meant to be part of the spa then it should be a child free area as it really isn\u2019t relaxing having kids running about, screaming and splashing. It isn\u2019t really fair when the majority of the clientele are couples trying to relax. Some places aren\u2019t really appropriate for small children. Whilst there is a \u2018quiet time\u2019 for adults only, this isn\u2019t widely advertised at the hotel and we didn\u2019t know about it. The spa does get very busy so late afternoon\u002Fearly evening is a good time to go; unfortunately this is when the kids are all there. ",5,positive

The buildings are timber-framed, hence can transmit noise (more on how to avoid that later). They are generally next to roads, so rooms need to be chosen carefully. They are basic.  That's why they are cheap. See them as \""camping-plus\"" rather than \""resort-minus\"".\n\nStarting from this fundamental understanding, this one is a little shabby, but most certainly value for money, doing exactly what it says on the tin.\n\nWhat's Good.\n\nAmple parking (though summer weekends may be an issue).  This is significant for me, as I pilot a large hire van from time to time.  Some Travelodges in town centres simply run out of spaces.\n\nClean.  It's probably around 25 years old, shows it's age slightly, but there were no \""yuk\"" moments.  \n\nEverything Worked.  Hot water, etc.  Some Lodges have an issue with water heating.\n\nFriendly Staff. After 250 miles or so, to be greeted by the cutie Heather on reception who reassigned my room to upstairs on the quiet side of the Lodge was truly refreshing for this weary road-warrior.  The welcome really does make a difference.  A little human warmth goes a long way.  Well done.\n\nShops and Food. The adjacent service area is better than most, with a number of shops and friendly staff.  You've left London now. Welcome to The West Country.\n\nWhat's Not So Good.\n\nNoise. You need to choose carefully here, as the main access road to the lorry park runs by the south side of the lodge. You may experience some noise.  Back to my opening observation -it's a lodge at a service area.\n\nAs it's a timber-framed building, if you're downstairs, you'll hear footsteps above you, just like at home.  Fine, as long as you're not below three insomniac Morris Dancers who like dancing in order to get back to sleep.  Choose an upstairs room if you can.\n\nParking Charges\n\nYou MUST enter your registration number on arrival or you'll cop a fine.

Oversized individuals may feel squeezed. The bed had one of those delicious overlay mattresses on ( they have a name which escapes me now)  which made it a dreamily comfortable night. The linen was fresh and crisp, of a good quality, as were the towels. Hand-pump bottles of soaps are supplied in the bathroom and in the bedroom, a more than adequate quantity of tea and coffee ( decaff also ) on a coffee table. Hair drier supplied and thank God, a bed-side Bible which for me is a sign of caring indulgence not a bible-bash!\n\nBreakfast is chosen from a varied menu, and choice of items and time required is organised more or less on arrival, and is a very good system. A note pad was left out for me with the menu. I chose, noted my requirements, which was whisked away at some stage, and all I had to do was turn up on time ( but getting out of that lovely bed wasn't easy. By the way, Diana's Lodge may be on a main road but I wasn't in the least disturbed. The front windows beyond the en-suite, are hidden behind a very tall fence and hedge, and to the side, is a garden and car area behind a tall gated fence - all very private) .

A small breakfast room was on the ground floor, with a selection of cereals and concentrated orange juice on the table. There was a pre-order system for either full English, scrambled egg and smoked salmon or continental breakfast. Full English came with a choice of eggs: scrambled, poached or fried; a single pork value sausage; 2 rashers of decent backed bacon; 3 mushrooms, (tomatoes - I didn't indulge ) and a ramekin of baked been that was blistering hot.  Tea or coffee and 2 pieces of toast (the center bar of the toaster does not work as the toast was not cooked on both sides).

The other two nights I was in the main single-bedded room.\n\nThe rooms are plain, clean and comfortable.

It takes a bit of getting used to, given that hotels and most guest houses now have en suite facilities. \n\nMy only complaint about the bathroom - and it is a minor complaint - is that the shower is one of those that requires one to fiddle around balancing the hot and cold water flow using the taps on the bath itself before pulling up a knob to redirect the water to the shower head. I never managed to achieve a satisfactory temperature - the cold water seemed not to make it through - and the water flow was far from generous.\n\nWhile the beds are comfortable, and the breakfast is magnificent.

11.43\ca\190801\1491102\126007835.html,London Road Garden Annex,"""At short notice we discovered this terrific self contained B & B (using Trip Advisor and following the reviews). Like others after one night we wished we were staying longer.  Jean & Mike have thought of everything you would need for a home away from home.  Mike is a retired Chef (but still doing outside catering and will cook for you with notice) and Jean is a professional gardener (the small garden outside the unit is delightful and in Spring\u002FSummer I am sure is amazing).  They are very friendly and lay back, just the right balance as immediate neighbours to the unit.  The unit is wonderfully clean and the bed linen is superb, the bed is super comfy.\nIf you were staying for a good length of time you would find the kitchen is brilliant for cooking even a roast dinner, cooking a cake even....there is everything there....even a dishwasher. Mike and Jean leave all the fresh ingredients in the refrigerator so you can cook your own cooked breakfast when you want, unlike other B & B's where you are perhaps locked into a set time. This includes sausages, bacon, eggs, tomatoes, mushrooms and fresh juice....and the wonderful home made fresh bread which greets you on arrival. \nAs others have mentioned the bathroom is a bit different....a deep walk in shower\u002Fbath (an elderly family member in the past needed this provision), the shower has a good supply of hot water.  There are top quality toiletries in the bathroom.  \nFinding the house, which is on a busy road, can be a bit tricky but once you are around the back where the unit is, there is absolutely no sound from the road. Off road parking for one car.  Looking through the guest register comments you can see how many people who have had longer stays have enjoyed all the unit has to offer. Speak to Mike and Jean about a better price on a weekly stay.  We do hope to return for a nice long stay next time.",5,positive

We were fortunate to have dinner there on the Saturday night and were treated to some real gourmet dining, Trevor really knows how to cook a steak properly.  They also know how to keep their beers well and we had some great local beers to try out as well.\n\nI could continue on for ages but will end my review with a simple comment, if you're considering booking The Peterborough Arms - do it!!  Much better value in my mind than some soul-less Travel Lodge.....",5,positive

The hosts were very welcoming and helpful. In fact I felt I was treated more like one of the family. Bramble (their field spaniel) that the hosts rescued after he was abandoned is equally friendly and welcoming and sits near the bar. Some people are put off staying in a pub because they think it might be noisy. This is not the case here, most of the clientele seem to be regulars (local cricket club, etc) or local residents. In any case this is what would be called a traditional pub with, thankfully (for me), no huge t.v. screen or loud music. I stayed two nights and had dinner each night. Very nice food, somewhere between good gastro pub and fine dining. The pub stocks a range of real ales too. Breakfast was good and very substantial. In fact on the second morning I had to ask for a smaller version. The accommodation I had was spacious set out in a self contained arrangement whereby my door opened into a hallway and corridor with the large bedroom and separate bathroom opening out from it. All in all, this is a very homely pub, totally unpretentious and where I felt totally at ease very quickly.",5,positive

Their dog was gorgeous and very friendly, although he does sometimes bark a welcome when people enter the pub; didn't  bother us at all but some folks may be cautious (the owners are actively training him not to bark).\nA lovely log fire was warming the pub on the cold January evenings we visited, and due to the excessive rainfall the road was flooding (as had the cellar earlier in the month apparently).\nThe pub was very quiet - I suspect the poor weather was keeping many away.\nThe food we ate on our second visit was truly superb!

Rooms were clean and comfortable and the hotel was a few minutes walk from the train station which was ideal for the trip into Bath we planned.  The staff were friendly and very helpful.  Breakfasts were standard Travelodge fare and perfectly fine, but the one evening meal we had was a disaster.  It's a fairly limited menu - mostly pizza and burgers - but that was okay, as it was what we wanted at the time.  The problem was that the food was poorly cooked and not very nice at all.  My daughter ordered the house salad as a starter and buttermilk chicken burger as a main course; both arrived together, the salad was swimming in dressing and the coating on the burger was soggy.  I ordered garlic bread with cheese to start and the halloumi burger.  My starter didn't arrive at all until I asked for it, and what turned up looked like a small baguette sliced in half and then sliced in the middle and coated with garlic butter and mozzarella, rather than separate slices of bread as I'd expected, and it was very hard to bite into and chew.  My burger had two patties, both of which were overcooked - in fact, around the edges, they were so tough and rubbery that I suspect they may have been cooked before and then re-cooked or re-heated.  And they were topped with a huge slab of raw halloumi - I had expected it to be cooked.  To be fair, the menu didn't say it was cooked so that assumption was mine, and I like raw halloumi - it just didn't work as a burger topping.\n\nOverall, we enjoyed our stay and would definitely re-visit, but we won't be having any evening meals there!",4,positive

There were so many little extras from the delicious home made cake and tea\u002Fcoffee upon our arrival, to the biscuits and toffees in our room each day. Breakfast consisted of everything you could imagine and was locally produced which ensured the freshness. Victoria happily provided us with a map which highlighted the most beautiful and interesting places to visit, which we found very useful being tourists unfamiliar with the country. After touring all day it was lovely to come home to the peace and tranquility of such a beautiful farm. The location is so handy to many towns in the Cotswolds. I loved walking around the property and visiting all the animals, and my husband ofcourse was interested in all the farm equipment. It was almost as if Victoria could read our minds as to what we needed. I have to say that this is the best B & B we have ever stayed in and we have stayed in many throughout the UK. I'm sure I have left out many wonderful praises for the Manor Farm and the only disappointment was having to leave after 4 nights. A huge thankyou Victoria and if we ever make it back to the UK you are first on our list to visit.",5,positive

So my first recommendation is not to expect your room to look like the photos I post here... The majority of rooms are nothing like this size! \n\nThe hotel scores well on a variety of fronts: value for money, location, free wi-fi and overall ambience. The bar area in particular has a variety of sofas and cosy spaces where it's a pleasure to spend time, with small candles added to the table and lights dimmed. The staff are competent and usually friendly, especially to their regulars, and happy to serve briskly at breakfast (where each hot meal is prepared to order). In addition, the guest questionnaire in the room is essentially a blank piece of paper leaving people free to write their own comments, which suggests to me that the hotel is keen to ensure they're not simply carrying out a tick-box exercise. I particularly like the fact that at dinner, if you're resident there's no need to wait to sign the bill (they simply charge the whole meal cost to your room): although don't like the fact that this means the staff tend to miss out on the tips they'd almost certainly receive at other hotels or restaurants. The staff are good enough not to create a system that bypasses rewarding them.\n\nI would also recommend that the reception area is tidied up (allowing residents to see into the back-office with its piles of paper is not a good look) and staff who work there should make more effort to greet residents they recognise by name - and in particular if they're Best Western reward card holders - as well as ensuring their standards of customer care and uniform standards are maintained. On occasions, the key has been virtually dumped on the counter and the \""Would you like a wake-up call or newspaper\"" question forgotten.\n\nBut please don't let that put you off! Overall, this is a well run hotel with clean, good size rooms and more amenities (such as a pool) you'd expect at this price point. The staff all know their jobs well and I'd be very surprised if anybody has an issue staying here.

For some reason Best Western, in my mind, conjures up budget hotels with low standards.\n\nOn arrival I was amazed by the size of our room (room 111 is a huge family room) as well as the hotel having an indoor swimming pool to keep our son occupied. The total price was \u00A3120 including breakfast (very good bacon). The room had a large sofa bed, incredibly comfortable king-sized bed, and a very large LG tv (possibly 47\"").\n\nHeavy wooden doors throughout the main part of the hotel give the impression that someone has thought about the interior rather than just opting for the cheapest alternative. Part of the dining room also has a mix-and-match approach to the chairs to give the feeling of a boutique hotel rather than a one-size-fits-all, generic chain.\n\nOn our arrival we were feeling tired, and so we decided to eat in the hotel. Again, not holding out much expectation of a decent meal I was hugely surprised by the cost and quality. We opted for the steak deal which, for \u00A322, offered two sirloin steaks and a bottle of wine. Usually sirloin is a tricky cut to get right, but these were incredibly tender and cooked perfectly (and delicious). Having lived in France, I know how the French rarely cook their steaks correctly - I just didn't expect them to be trumped by a Best Western in Chippenham! Whilst the steaks were seared, they had then, correctly, been finished in the oven to allow for the inside to be cooked. Our rare steaks (NB not RAW - as you would often find them) were perfect.\n\nEveryone whether it was the cleaning staff, reception or bar\u002Frestaurant staff was incredibly polite and friendly and the central phone booking line was very efficient. A special mention must go to the lady who served our dinner and extremely kindly searched out some chocolates for us as we couldn't manage an entire pudding.

We booked 3 rooms last year after the last visit to Badminton, as usual we arrived last night at the Angel  Hotel very tired after a very early start and long drive from (2 couples) from North Yorkshire and (one couple) from Shropshire. We had spent the day walking the course and shopping, so ready for a hot shower and a nice relaxing drink in the bar. What a shock and disappointment! to be told the Hotel had no bookings in our names, this was despite the Hotel ringing one of our party 4 weeks previous to check we still wanted the rooms, which of course we confirmed yes we did. The young duty manager did his best to deal with the situation but unfortunately he failed to handle the problem very professionally, instead of taking us into a quiet corner and offering us a drink while he tried to get to the bottom of the situation, he allowed us to stand around  in the foyer in front of other customers trying to  have a relaxing drink and he could not explain to us what had gone wrong with our booking. He confirmed that the hotel was full and we could not stay there. He then left us standing around while he tried to find us alternative accommodation. He eventually found us another Hotel in Swindon which is 45 minutes away! We had planned to be back in Badminton early on Sunday to see the trot up, obviously that was not going to be possible due to the distance. The young duty manager did accept responsibility and showed enough grace to apologise even though clearly it was not his fault. He promised that the hotel manager Damian would call us this afternoon, this call has only added to our disappointment, anger and frustration, as Damian didn't bother to apologise and indicated that he didn't really believe that we had booked the rooms! Does he really think we would drive all that way on Badminton weekend and just hope they would have 3 rooms!  I would suggest that Damian is sent on a course to improve his skills in customer service. I have a business and  in my experience reputation is everything. We all understand that sometimes things can go wrong, but the way this has been dealt with has left us with a very bad impression of this Hotel, and we will never go back there again. I would also think that all of the customers having a drink last night must have felt very uncomfortable. Very disappointing experience after being loyal customers for several years.

Sadly none engaged with us to welcome us or investigate if we wanted a room, coffee, drink, food or use the gym and pool...missed opportunities and didn't create a good impression really in customer service.\n\nThe young lady behind the bar gave us a wonderful smile and polite greeting...the first! Having ordered\nAs we were wanting lunch we followed the signs instructions and took a table, noted the number and gave our food order at the bar....until that point, no staff involved...not even a smile following eye contact with many of them in the vain hope of recognition!  While I appreciate it may be a simple thing to do, a bit if customer service and interaction would be nice! Instead of a classy hotel feel, it was more a feel of a typical Best Western service, good but lacked the WOW factor!\n\nWe had a look at the menu, placed our order and got some drinks...be warned if you fancy a pint chaps...pint of guest beer was \u00A34.05!! Extortionate! \nMy husband had the breaded plaice with new potatoes and salad.  I had the pan fried chicken in a leek and bacon sauce....very tasty, but I had to send it back asking for more sauce as lacking!\n\nWaiting staff were polite, helpful and in smart unirorms, but need to always be watching their customers when walking around as it took 3 attempts to get anyone's attention.

The room (located in main part of the hotel) was great - a lovely mix of modern and old. I had no view to speak of - but this wasn't a problem. There is no elevator in the building (it's old and probably listed) so if stairs are a problem let the booking people know that. My room was well appointed with lots of plugs and free wifi. I had a big modern style king size four poster - the mattress was a tad uncomfortable (a mattress topper would help minimize the discomfort of coil\u002Fsprings). An absolute bonus for me was the presence of a great little gym and pool. The hotel has a number of lovely public areas with comfy sofas and chairs - all around a very nice place to stay for a few days. I ate breakfast there and each morning requested veggie sausages - the first morning I was told they were usually available - but they'd just run out. So I had a cheese and mushroom omelette instead - very nice of them to make for me, but it was unfortunately pretty grim (overcooked and fried on both sides). Coffee was weak and like dishwater - nasty. No veggie sausages on subsequent days - so not really great breakfast options for vegetarians. Dinner on the last night - was also a bit of a drag: I was told they weren't taking restaurant bookings until after 8pm because they had a banquet - and the restaurant was full. 'Full' meant three or four tables! The banquet was for 13 people apparently - I suppose this must have been an understaffing issue in the kitchen, but was somewhat bewildering and annoying to see a virtually empty restaurant being described to me as 'fully booked'. Dinner service doesn't start in the restaurant until 7pm on regular days either - so families might find that inconvenient. I'd definitely stay here again, the staff were young, helpful and pleasant, and apart from some issues with the restaurant - I was happy with my stay. Sorting out breakfast and dining - offering better coffee and making the mattress more comfortable - the Best Western Angel Plus would have scored an overall 4 or 5 from me.",3,negative

Our room, 201, was over the gym and the background noise of TVs could be heard which was mentioned to reception who immediately sent someone to turn them down. On another occasion shouting could be heard from guests in the gym for a short while. It was only heard in the background but was still a little irritating. This appeared to affect just the rooms directly over the gym, and to be fair it was not a constant noise, nor was it late at night and would depend not only on how many guests used gym, but also on how noisy they were, but it is a point to consider.\nThe room itself was clean and large, with a king size double, free Wi-Fi, tea and coffee making facilities, hair dryer, toiletries, a large TV and adequate plugs and storage. There were plenty of towels and bedding and, apart from the occasional noise from below, the room was quiet with no traffic noise.\nStaff were all helpful and friendly and breakfast is excellent with a well-cooked full English plus a range of self-serve cereals and extensive Continental items.\nWe ate in the restaurant twice where the food was good and reasonably priced. There was a problem with a steak on the second occasion, it looked fine but a large portion was inedible.

There is alternative parking close by but, all of this time restricted during the day, but unrestricted between 6.00pm and 8.00am.\nThe view of the front of the hotel is in the pedestrianised centre. Which only has access for Taxis. You will approach the modern rear of the building.  The Angel is a period hotel with a modern extension which you will walk through to reach the reception in the old building.  I stayed in the old period building which has lots of quirks, which have been screened by an ill conceived modern look. \n\nThe reception area itself has the feel of an afterthought. It looks like a converted broom cupboard with a stainless steel or aluminium screen which does not lend itself to a welcome for the visitor. The staff are friendly and helpful. Being in the old part of the building there are sudden level changes the receptionist warns you of and I part fell into my room as the step up is immediately behind the door as you open it.\nOn the plus side the room size is generous, excellent bed with a big bath\u002Fshower room. The lighting though was dim. There was a dimmer switch but I could not raise the light level. During my stay, there was no hot water before 6.00am and I could not get any hot water in the shower for the two days I stayed. The carpet looked a little grubby. Not unhealthy but probably ready for a clean and the bath mat towel was frayed. \nBar  area expansive though a little small, again clean, very modern, functional without being welcoming. Pricing is standard hotel, personally I thought the wine expensive, but I can be difficult to please. Restaurant is a good size, service is slow, and the menu limited a wide choice of steaks but as an example if you wanted fish there was just fish and chips. Observing other tables there was a good selection of vegetables for those who ordered them. Again very friendly and attentive staff. I had mussels which were overcooked, I think this was a matter of timing as I was with a group. So okay but not recommended as a dining experience.

The staff were all very helpful and attentive and nothing was too much trouble for any of them. We all chose a roast dinner followed by a dessert. The food was cooked to perfection and there was ample vegetables for all. I asked for extra gravy (always do with roast dinners) and they obliged at no extra charge (I've had to pay in the past in some establishments). We didn't feel rushed at all and ate at our own pace. We were offered a free coffee if we wanted it as part of the 2 course menu. We declined and settled for another alcoholic beverage. It was a very relaxing Sunday afternoon. Only criticism is I felt the bottle of wine was a little expensive but after all it is a hotel. We will definitely visit again for Sunday lunch.",5,positive

Our stay at the Angel was a pleasure in many ways, particularly the staff who were friendly and went out of their way to be helpful.  The room was over the gym but as we were out most of the time enjoying the delights of the festival this did not bother us.  It was a very pleasant room with all we could wish for although I did find the bed a bit soft for my liking and the duvet at bit hard. The only disappointment was the menu change over the long weekend.  We had enjoyed the extensive and delicious menu offered outside the festival period but once the festival started we only had limited choices offered.  We understand they are exceptionally busy over the festival weekend, but suggest that they could revert to the more extensive menu for the bank holiday Monday evening as many of the festival goers will have left by then and the staff should be less under pressure.  Needless to say we have rebooked for next year.",5,positive
11.43\ca\190801\192922\379475114.html,Best Western Plus Angel Hotel,"""We stayed here for four nights in the main, older part of the hotel in the Bromham Room (no room number). Your GPS might lead you to the front part of the hotel, but that is for taxis and drop-off only. There is a car-free plaza right in front of the hotel so the parking lot is actually in the back part of the property, near the newer section of the hotel. Adequate amount of parking space, except for when an event was held in one of the hotel's meeting rooms on one of the nights.\n\nIn order to get to the reception desk from the parking lot, you walk through the newer building (where gym and pool are), out the back door into a lovely courtyard with trees, flowers, and some tables, then back into the older part of the complex and head down a hallway towards the front. The small, metallic, modern reception desk, as another reviewer stated, is really odd and out of place with the old-time charm and decor of the hotel. At first we weren't even sure that was where we checked in. There is a pleasant, comfortable seating area with wonderful decor just inside the front door near the plaza. You can have drinks and snacks in here, too.\n\nWe headed up to our room, carrying our somewhat heavy suitcases up the stairs (no elevator). A little quirky to get to our room: we went through another narrow passageway that had a few steps, and then opened a few doors to get to our room. We did enjoy our very spacious, clean room with a four-poster bed (with a bench at the foot of it), fireplace, huge closet, large desk and chair, dresser with flat screen tv on it, two bedside tables, a tall standing fan, and lounge chair with footstool. There were also two windows in the room, with little alcoves that held seat cushions. Lovely atmosphere all around!\n\nThe bathroom was quite large, also, and had a window with a cushioned seat bench underneath it. Long counter area above the sink and toilet area to store personal items. The tub had a shower, which worked just fine.\n\nWe ate breakfast and dinner in the restaurant. Staff was pleasant and capable at all meals. Breakfast was buffet, with not a lot of selection, but it was adequate. You could also order additional hot items from the server, too. The dinner menu offered some really delicious food and we enjoyed all of it.\n\nOur only problem was noise, which bothered us two out of the four nights (weekend nights) due to our room's location. The hotel is located next to a bar and the revelers were out shouting and partying on the plaza until the wee hours of the morning. In addition, a wedding party was drinking and screaming in the courtyard for several hours--we complained the next morning to the receptionist who said the hotel was aware of that problem and would handle the situation. \n\nWe chose this hotel because of its close location to Bath--perhaps a 20 minute drive--and also because of the good reviews and adequate parking. If we stayed here again, we would probably ask for a room away from the street noise.",4,positive

Breakfast we prepaid for was a disappointing offering. Continental breakfast can be really satisfying. But pale undercooked white bread rolls with a few small, yesterday's Danish, or packet cereals of all sorts, meet you as you ponder which tinned fruit to pick with your low fat low quality yogurt! Oh but you can have white or granary toast. Alternatively one can pay an extra \u00A312 for a full English. Really? Here was a hotel offering very good accommodation but expects the guest to think that a low grade breakfast suffices. Come on Angel, give your guests a choice of difference. Premier, ibis and other budget hotels offer better quality breakfasts than you. Give your guests fresh fruit choices, artisan breads and pastries, sausages, egg and bacon from local producers. Maybe even a choice of eggs Benedict or scrambled eggs and a little smoked salmon.  Yogurts that are local, or at least tasty. Even decent jams and marmalade would have been nice instead of cheaply produced high sugar options that are tasteless. Match the lovely hotel with a lovely breakfast. Be different to and special enough from the budget hotels. You are very different!\nHmmmm, the coffee was fine though.",3,negative

11.43\ca\190801\192922\388726462.html,Best Western Plus Angel Hotel,"""We stayed for a two night break which included 2 breakfasts and one dinner. The hotel is right on the Market Place and has a very cleverly built extension at the rear which provides a lovely courtyard\u002Fsitting area, additional accommodation and a good sized car park. \nWe are 'sheets and blankets' people and always ask for them instead of duvets if possible and nine times out of ten, our request gets lost somewhere along the way and we have to ask housekeeping to come and put things right. However, not The Angel Hotel. We were delighted as it saves so much hassle if they get it right first time. Well done to housekeeping and as a result we slept really well in our room which was both spacious and well furnished.\nWe had our meal in the dining room. The service was excellent but we thought the food was rather average. My steak was very chewy and the chips were soggy. The promised field mushroom was replaced with a few button mushrooms scattered on the plate. The batter on my husband's fish was lacking crispness and the fish was quite small. Presentation was very basic. I suggest they invest in better quality frozen chips or do their own 'twice fried' chips and maybe serve them in some little individual chip baskets so that the chips stay crisp and the whole presentation is improved. A little imagination from the head chef is desperately needed.\nI ordered rhubarb & ginger sponge for afters but it was not available and my husband's fresh fruit salad was, again, very basic. No berry fruits at all, not even a strawberry or raspberry (now in season) among the usual apple, pear, kiwi and orange. Very dull indeed. \nUnfortunately the food offer was no better the next day at breakfast. Having said that, there was a good selection of cereals and bits and pieces to go on top, dried fruits, nuts etc. which were fine plus a basic selection of whole fruit, apples mainly and one banana which I grabbed. There was then a choice of the usual cooked breakfast with a choice of eggs. My husband chose a poached egg which, when it arrived was so overcooked it was solid and inedible. I had the buffet and I have never seen such a tiny offering of cheeses and meats, never mind the bread offer which consisted of cold dry croissants, just out of the packet I imagine, some anaemic looking rolls that looked like the cheap long-life ones that need to be baked off, except they didn't look as if they had been, and one, yes one, tiny Danish pastry, similarly pale and looking rather sad. I have a personal hatred of foil butter portions and plastic jam portions, which I suspect come straight from the cash and carry. Why they can't offer better quality jam and butter, I just don't understand. We go to hotels a lot for short breaks now that we are retired and we look forward to a lovely selection for breakfast (the best part of the stay in my opinion), so breakfast for us was a real let-down at The Angel and, we both thought, one of the least impressive that we have had in many a year. \nThis is a lovely hotel that needs to get its act together regarding the quality and presentation of their food which is really letting the hotel down.",3,negative

The receptionist was really friendly and welcoming, and instructions to our accommodation were very clear (though the garden)  but very, very clean and quiet. The only downside was that we decided have some lunch and ordered some sandwiches which took nearly an hour to come!  The restaurant only had a few people in it and so we could not see the hold-up so we asked where our lunch was.  They soon arrived.  On the flip side, in the morning we sat down for breakfast and literally and I mean literally before I had even sat down I was asked for my order!  I scrambled for my glasses and grabbed for the menu.  I was so flustered that I ordered the full breakfast with poached egg instead of fried.  The egg was not cooked at all! The sausage looked aneamic. And literally before I had even ordered the breakfast it soon arrived on the table (maybe that's why my egg was so under cooked!).

Was nice looking out onto the town square with the Christmas tree in it too. Would honestly give the place 5 stars, however the restaurant and bar is THAT awful that I've given it the rating I have. 55 minutes wait for a sandwich and a baked potato (that we had to send back because it was wrong) and then once the sandwich had come back it was too disgusting to eat. Also, 3.50 for a pint of coke? That's the most I think I've ever paid for a draught coke and i think taking advantage of guests like that shows total contempt for them (we all know it costs a few pence at most). Then in the morning there was the breakfast debacle - well over an hour for a revolting inedible breakfast (that they have the cheek to charge \u00A312 per person for)!! We'd paid for breakfast as part of our rate which was annoying as we'd have left otherwise. It wasn't just us suffering, a couple near us just cancelled after 45 mins of waiting and just left and people were openly laughing and mocking the service. A couple next to us received the wrong order after their wait. All the lady had ordered was three boiled eggs and she got three fried ones. She was told it would take another 20 minutes!!! Yes 20 for some boiled eggs to replace those ones! We ate what we could and left, very angry. Clearly they were understaffed but that's not the guests fault, that's managements fault - They should have been giving everybody free breakfast for how awful it was and refunding \u00A312 each for everybody who had already paid. But no - sod all of the paying guests and take no responsibility for the mess. So after that nice long rant I would say this - if you're just looking for a bed for the night then go for it, but if you're looking to enjoy spending any time in the hotel at all then forget it until they've sorted themselves out.

The event team were very organised; all the staff were welcoming to our 80 odd guests many of whom came from across the UK and abroad and who stayed at the hotel and the event was a roaring success.  \n\nThe buffet was generous and suitable for a family gathering; the rooms and breakfast are excellent value for the price too. \n\nLocation is also excellent - with a reasonable sized car park at the rear (make sure you use the postcode supplied or you will be trying to park at the front of the hotel and unable to get your car near).\n\nThis time we had my parents' Diamond Wedding Anniversary party - held at the same venue by popular request.  The hotel is ideal for our mixed family gathering (9 months to 90 years) because it has enough rooms and is central for people travelling from the North, South and West - and those flying in.  \n\nThe manager in charge of events (Suzanne) remembered our first party and with her guidance and the excellent team it was easy to set up the party and let them get on with the delivery.   \n\nAgain the food was exactly what you want to cater for an informal, family reunion - plentiful and simple but tasty.  Organisation of the food and drink - and service went without a hitch.   We had one waitress (Elaine) who was with us most of the day and took great care of us.   The duty managers were Balint and Alicya - and they were very attentive.   Thanks also to the reception team and the back room staff\u002FKitchen team who also played a part in making the weekend a success.  Some of the family who hadn't been together for years stayed on into the evening in the party room and the staff were kind enough to accommodate them and brought out the remaining sandwiches that had been put in the fridge in case of such an event.\n\nI am only sorry that, yet again, I didn't get the opportunity to explore Chippenham as I was very busy organising and hosting - but a quick walk round on Sunday suggests we should come back another day.\n\nThe hotel is a lovely, welcoming place and the pretty town centre location a bonus.",5,positive

The restaurant was otherwise empty but it took almost two hours to serve a group of eleven people two courses. The food overall however was fine. Due to the delays we pre-booked the next night in advance. Seven of us for 7.30 and two at 8.30. This really threw them!\n\nOn arriving at 7.30 I asked the young waitress if the tables could be placed together as they had been the previous night. Again the restuarant was empty. She gave me such a dirty look and said \""But you are all arriving at different times, how can we?\"" I advised her differently and she simply shrugged, turned her back on me and walked away. Disgusting service, we put the tables together ourselves helped by one of the male waiters who although quiet, was OK.\n\nWhen we did get seated we discovered there had been a mistake (theirs) about some of the orders and once again the young waitress treated us all with the utmost disrepect, like it was our fault and we should just put up with it. The food was also, on the whole, pretty hopeless. Cod in batter which was all batter and luke warm chips. Chicken and tarrogan which I had enjoyed the night before was a different dish and nowhere near as good. The fish pie contained mussels so should be labelled seafood pie and in one case was still cold in the middle. Soup with no bread, the list goes on. Awful.\n\nThe young reception staff also look down their nose at you, I advised one that I would be leaving early the next morning and asked if there would there be someone at reception to check me out. Without even looking up she simply said, \""the night porter\"". Customer service? What customer service. And as for the night porter:\n\nI duly arrived at the reception desk at just after 4.30am. The elderly night porter arrived and had obviously just woken up. I said hello, apologised for the early start but as I had a long journey I wanted to miss the traffic. He just ignored me. I stood and waited to check out and he said, \""Room number?\"" He then wen't on to print off a sheet and advised me that I owed over \u00A390.00. I advised him that the bill had been settled my my organisation to which he said OK, but he still needed to print off the receipt which he did so and asked me to sign. I asked why to which he replied, \""Just sign it\"". Ignorant, rude and with no customer service skills at all I should have told him what to do with it!\n\nThe room was comfortable, the room service staff cheerful and very polite, the other hotel staff could learn a lot from them.

Nice hotel, conveniently located and tastefully presented with pleasant and helpful staff.\n\nBedroom was well furnished, clean and comfortable although as a twin room it seemed churlish to have only one packet of biscuits and one hot chocolate sachet. Wifi was good and the only downside was that noise was discernible from adjacent rooms and the outside corridor but didn't disturb our sleep.\n\nBathroom adequate, and although it didn't really have an impact upon our stay there were many cracked floor tiles and the sink plug hole hadn't been cleaned properly for quite some time.\n\nBar quite expensive, but then what hotel isn't these days?\n\nFood was similar to a couple of the other reviews already here. The rationale on the  dinner for our big group was to deliver similar meals (we had pre-ordered) to each table and then other choices in turn, meaning some people had to wait a few minutes until all at the table were served and then a further wait for the vegetables. My roast was so cold, despite being on a hot plate, that after one mouthful I asked for it to be re-heated. A new plate was then supplied, but the food was again only luke warm and had been put on a cold plate and it again went back! The third attempt was successful, but by that time the vegetables were decidedly cool but I put up with it whilst my partner hardly eat anything at all. The whole table thought it a poor way of doing things. Of the food, the beef was very chewy and my starter of soup was sadly lacking of a tomato taste  whilst the prawn cocktail delivered to my partner (and some of the others) was the most tasteless I have come across ( I tried it) and I am told  the plaice dish was much the same. The fruit salad was 'fresh' but although there was the odd piece pineapple, orange  and mango, the majority of it was apple and seemed a bit of a cheap way of doing it - perhaps I was unlucky in my serving, but I overheard another of the party asking for an apple free plate?\n\nBreakfast was quite good, although on the second morning we had to ask someone to take our order when despite having a reasonable number of waiters\u002Fwaitresses they were all frantically clearing away tables. Once ordered the food was hot and quickly delivered.\n\nI suspect being in a large group in a separate dining room may have lead to the quality being suspect, but I feel sorry for any wedding party  who suffered similarly.

It was very quiet which was surprising given the location of the Hotel and that our window faced the car park. The staff were very friendly and accommodating.\nThe thing that let the whole weekend experience down was the quality of the food. I ended up having very little to eat over the weekend as the food was not good. I had the prawn cocktail on the first night and it had absolutely NO taste whatsoever. It was like eating water. They brought me some extra lemon to try and give it some flavour. This was followed by cold beef and cold Yorkshire puddings. I was served first at a table of six and had to sit for ages waiting for the others to be served and then for the vegetables to arrive. The beef was very tough and the meal was returned to the kitchen but the replacement meal was no better, still cold and on a cold plate. The next night I ordered the mackerel pate and the fish thinking that was the safest option. The pate arrived with two of the tiniest pieces of Melba toast, not enough to put the pate on, and the fish was again absolutely tasteless. I had ordered the fruit salad which promised to be fresh and all I got was a plate full of chopped apple.\nI think something really needs to be done when serving food to a table. Everyone should get their food at the same time and it should be hot. The staff were apologetic and did what they could to help but if the food is leaving the kitchen cold and tasteless then there is little they can do.\nThe Hotel was very nice but the food let the weekend down.

Well, not today, unfortunately.  It was bland with a strange creamy colour.  Usually, it's white with a fresh fish flavour.  I did eat about half of it, but was concerned that it might be off, so I sent it back.  The chef said, that it was alright, but it was just the way it was prepared.  As I was still hungry I ordered the carrot & coriander soup to replace it, but was told as I had eaten half of the fish, I would have to pay for the soup as well. I would have expected as a gesture of courtesy and to ensure customer satisfaction, not to mention repeat business, that they might have offered me the soup free of charge.  However, when the soup arrived I could not believe it as it was so unpalatable, i.e. hot and peppery, I was unable to eat it.  I can't help thinking that the chef deliberately over-spiced it as I had complained about the fish tasting bland.

I booked this mainly because it was a Best Western which I have always had good experiences with and also because this hotel is pet friendly.  I don't expect Best Western to be 5 star but in general they are always clean and have good service.  I am totally disappointed by my stay at this hotel.  It is very rare that I write a poor review but in this instance one is warranted.  On arrival we could not get any parking in the car park.  It is very small and was totally full. I was told to park in a car park next door (down street). I asked if I had to pay for this and was told I did.  This is an hourly charge with a max of two hours stay, so what was I to do with my car then?  I stayed in the car until a space finally became available.  Not a good start.  \n\nI had two rooms booked, one for myself and my husband and the other for my mam.  There is no elevator in the hotel. One room was on the top floor and the other on the ground.  The ground floor room was taken by my elderly mam as she could not climb two long flights of stairs.  My room was a nice size.  The decor was modern and no issues with that.  However I do have an issue with the cleanliness of the rooms.  The toilet in the room doesn't look like it has seen a brush in years, probably since it was installed. It is grotty down in it, brown to be exact.  The two cups provided were stained both inside and out.  We were given one packet of biscuits every day for two people.....great for figure!  We used the glasses provided in room every day, and every day after the room was cleaned we had to wash our own glasses as they were left dirty beside the bed.  One day the towel provided was stained.  Needless to say we threw that on the floor and shared the other towel between us.  We made coffee in the room on the first day (after washing the cups well!) and the next day the sugar was not replenished, so tough if you need a second cup during your stay and take sugar, as there was none provided.  The second day when we returned there was a long black hair hanging off the edge of the bath....not ours as we dont have long black hair!\n\nWe were staying for 4 nights.  On the second day we left the hotel at 10am and returned at 4pm to find the room was not cleaned, even though we hung the 'make up room' sign on the door.  I rang housekeeping and they said they would clean it then. I had to go sit in reception for 30 mins with our pet while they cleaned it.  Housekeeping said that the checkin guest rooms takes priority.  But that night the carpark wasnt nearly full and I would say according to the number at breakfast the hotel was far from full, so not sure why our room was not prioritised.\n\nThe second room although a better experience was still not cleaned well and hair was left in the bathroom from another guest.\n\nI complained to reception on the 3rd morning about the cleanliness of the room. All she said was 'did I mention it the day before', which I said I didn't, so she said she would mention it to housekeeping. Needless to say nothing much improved on day 3 apart from the glasses being washed for us ....thank you!.  The toilet is still brown and grotty.  Not sure if they cant afford a toilet brush!  Surely there is a housekeeping manager that oversees the rooms to ensure the standard is maintained?\n\nBreakfast is OK, nothing amazing.  Buffet is pretty poor\u002Fbasic, just some cereals, no prunes or anything out of the norm.  Hopefully you are not in a hurry though as it took 30-35 mins to get a fry served to us, by which time the toast was stone cold and the coffee to.  They must have had to go to shop to get the contents before they could start cooking. They were not even busy. Just a few tables in use when we were there and several waitresses present, so no excuse for taking so long.  \n\nThe hotel is OK but very poor on a number of fronts.  I wouldn't recommend it if you have a choice.  We moved from Best Western Crudwell to this Best Western due to lack of availablilty for the remainder of our stay at the Crudwell Best Western.  The Best Western Crudwell is much older hotel, but was a fantastic stay and the staff could not have done enough for you.  They were truly amazing and have perfected the customer relations piece.  Pity about the Chippenham Best Western.  I am not sure how they got 'Angel' and 'Plus' status, but they need to work on their housekeeping and overall customer service.  This is the first time I have stayed in a 'Plus' Best Western, so was truly disappointed.  Even mentioning to reception that I was not happy didn't improve anything! Its like they just couldn't care less.\n\nOn a positive they have free WIFI and it is not bad, but you have to connect every day. No big deal. They also have a small pool and gym, but I didn't use these.  The other plus is that they are pet friendly which is great!",3,negative

The housekeeping staff are fantastic and the hotel is certainly comfortable however the restaurant  service was very poor.  Friday evening and Saturday evening we waited nearly three quarters of an hour for our food and when it appeared one had to be returned as it was cold. The excuse from one member of staff was that they were very busy and he shrugged his shoulders.  When we asked for a jug of water we were told \"" I'll see what I can do but we're very busy\""  Not the best responses.  Breakfast is now self service but when we arrived for ours we had to reset our own table and find crockery excetera from other tables leftovers.  No-one appeared to be keeping a check on what needed \""topping up\"" and for example when eggs finally appeared, there were no plates..  Very poor indeed.  There seemed to be very few waiting staff and the manager was conspicuous by his absence.  Many of the other residence felt the same and at check-out time there was a queue of people complaining.  There does not appear to be any one taking responsibility for training frontline staff in customer services.  It is quite clear that the catering and housekeeping staff were under extreme pressure and the management team was in complete denial of the issues .

Always like it when a jug of water is put on the table, which they did.   The town itself is quiet with lots of charity shops, but well located for Laycock and Avebury which is why we stayed here.

We seated ourselves in the 'dining area' (I hesitate to call it the restaurant) and ordered our meal. Waitress (and reception staff for that matter) polite and accommodating enough - but not so the barman who duly brought us a bottle of house red with two of the smallest glasses he could find, plonked the wine down - unnecessarily forcefully I thought - unscrewed the cap and left us to it without so much as a by your leave. After a few moments I approached him at the bar and asked if it might be possible to be given two larger glasses. He grudgingly gave me one large one and another slightly larger one claiming that all the other large wine glasses were \""out in the rooms\"". However, barely a few moments later he passed our table several times with full large glasses.He must have overheard me remarking on this to my wife as, on returning to the bar, he commented (presumably by way of explanation) that he had since \""instructed his staff\"" (his staff?) to collect more glasses from the rooms and walked off without waiting for my reply. As he walked away I asked if we might then have a second larger glass but he made no response and no such glass was ever brought to us. When I raised the matter with him on departing he muttered something and retreated to the back of the bar where I couldn't see him. I should mention that I'm a 68 year-old male, have dined in some of the finest hotels in the world and just because my wife and I had taken advantage of a promotional offer I saw no reason why we should have been treated with such derisive contempt. Presumably this arrogant employee, in his wisdom, had deterined that because the wine was complimentary it called for nothing more than the smallest glasses on the shelf.

We had a great meal, then went to our room. The room was beautiful and very clean with everything we needed. The breakfast the next morning was cooked to order and hot and delicious. We checked out of room and headed south to Stonehenge. We also took time to see other things in the area. Before we knew it, the day was coming to an end and we realized that we would not make it home that night. I called the Jolly Huntsman and they had one room left and they were nice enough to hold it for us. We got back there, got our same room and had a delicious dinner. Again, with very friendly staff and we had a nice time visiting with the other customers there. I live in the U.S. and  was visiting England. My plan is to return to England to visit and now, no visit would be complete without a visit to the Jolly Huntsman. I plan to stay for at least 5 days next time. It is such a relaxing time with good food, good drink and good people. The selections of food and drink are great. Thank you to the staff and owners for making our time there so memorable. Hope to see them again soon. Am not sure if there was a pool there, but I am sure it is as good as everything else so I rated it excellent like everything else!",5,positive

The room was quite small and very basic, although clean.  The towels had seen better days frayed and scraggy on the edges.

Very snug and folks were double parked later on! Perhaps they should reserve some spaces for residents only? \n\nShown to my room which was on ground floor in the cottage (room 10). Advised the Wi-Fi code was posted on the notice, which it was. However, my iPad Wi-Fi could only see the pub router, not the one apparently in the accommodation block. Tried when in the room and the code did not work, so I could not get connected to the Wi-Fi in the room  - BIG issue for me, as I am here on business and need to work in evening as well as stay in touch with friends and family.\n\nNo phone signal in room either, so with no Wi-Fi (and no hotel phone provided) meant I was effectively isolated once in the room. Not acceptable in 21st century!\n\nThe Wi-Fi does however work fine in the pub and I was able to connect here. Ate a 3 course meal in the pub, the food tasted nice and the portions were ample but I could not finish the meal. \n\nWas subsequently very ill during the night and as this was the only meal I had taken that day I must assume my illness was caused by the food eaten at the pub. \n\nAs I was unable to sleep all night, I could therefore enjoy a good 8 hours of the NO WIFI facilities, no water, limited tea and coffee and a weak TV signal which resulted in intermittent breaking of the sound and pixelated video. \n\nRoom was also cold, although in truth this could have been because I felt unwell and was shivering. The pillows and mattress were too soft for me but may suit others. \n\nWardrobe was a half-sized cupboard with door that stuck and I \""double-hung\"" my clothes to avoid them dragging on the floor. There was an iron and ironing board in there though which was a good addition.\n\nDidn't want to chance the breakfast the next day so I just checked out. Was initially asked to pay for the full 2 nights (cheeky) but once I explained why I was leaving they were gracious enough not to insist on this. \n\nI booked in for 2 nights here but left after 1 and would not return here. Perhaps I was unlucky, I know colleagues of mine have stayed here before and not had these issues. I would say this may suit guys more than gals, it is rather \""rough and ready\"" and lacking the basic standards that business travellers are entitled to expect (ie facilities working as advertised and a reasonable chance of a good nights sleep). I've stayed in other local pub B&B's so have a realistic expectation - this would not be 5 * hotel - but was sorely disappointed by the quality of my stay here.",1,negative

Whilst I got parked relatively easily, within 10 minutes of arriving the car park was full and people were parking down the road on the high street. My guests arrived about 7pm and had a long walk to the pub. Maybe they should reserve the parking spaces at the rear for residents only as that would help matters.\n\nThe room was lovely. It was warm and inviting and for the price it was more than acceptable. Only two issues. The shower had seen better days and really needs to be replaced with a new one. Also the walls and ceiling (I was ground floor) were paper-thin. I really am not joking, I could hear everything happening in the bedroom above me!! This could affect light sleepers quite badly...\n\nHad breakfast here the next morning which they allowed me to have a little earlier than the advertised 7-30 AM. It was really nice and is also good to see rules bend occasionally to help customers and their needs.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this inn but maybe take ear-plugs.",4,positive

I chose this establishment for its convenient location to the social event that I was attending and unfortunately this was the only thing that lived up to my expectation. \nI decided to make a day of it & set off early specifically so that I could enjoy lunch in the pub. Unfortunately the traffic was heavy & I missed the exit to the village because of roadworks, arriving at 7minutes passed 2pm I was told that I was too late for lunch (despite the fact that I was a resident & I counted at least four kitchen staff on site), forcing me to drive in an unfamiliar area for an alternative. Upon returning to my allocated room (no 7) it became apparent that once again despite booking well in advance I had been penalised for being a solo female traveller by being put into a room which frankly, to be polite, has seen better days & at \u00A365 per night paying only \u00A315 less than a couple for the same room I expected more. I would have requested to move had I been able to find anyone on my return, but the pub was closed & nobody was around.\nThe decor was very tired with frayed carpets, chipped and scuffed utilitarian furniture & a slightly unloved feel about it. The socket behind the bedside table which I wanted to plug the bedside light into was loose & coming away from the wall. The lock had been removed from the bathroom door leaving a hole & it wouldn't close properly either. The shower was a hose attachment on the taps which was too short to hang from the wall had their been somewhere to attach it to. I had to shower like a 5 year old with a sponge down sitting in the bath & then trying to wash off the lather without turning the bathroom into a swimming pool. The towels were old and smelt damp & slightly musty when used. As indicated by other reviewers the noise of heavy footsteps from the rooms above can be heard clearly, as could the water from the facilities which must have been carried down behind my bedroom wall as it sounded like a waterfall every time a tap was turned on. \nI could go on, but having read the response from the owners to other reviewers I'm sure they will disagree with my observations (I did take photographs) and neither apologise or offer a refund. Suffice to say I shall vote with my feet and next time I am in the area stay at the premier inn up the road. I am all for supporting independent traders but only when they rise to occasion. \nThe staff were pleasant and the breakfast was good & had I been asked when checking out if I had enjoyed my stay I would have told them my concerns. Upon paying the bill I was told \""that is just \u00A365\"". It may just be \u00A365 to you but it is money that I had to work hard for & you didn't work hard enough to take it from me.

No point complaining as I was starving after a long journey.  \nRoom was clean but the wall in the bathroom could do with a lick of paint and the bath de scaling. We rushed for breakfast before another journey.

Yes, we accepted that pets were welcome but didn\u2019t realise they would be sat next to food.\nOur first night was really good and the mattress was comfy.\nUnfortunately, it was downhill from there.\nThe following morning breakfast was slow and we waited half an hour for it to arrive. My eggs with soldiers were solid so no dipping for me! Instead, I used the jam and discarded the eggs. We didn\u2019t fancy sending it back as we were on a tight schedule and couldn\u2019t wait another half an hour! The tables weren\u2019t cleared away and people were queueing to sit down.

Surely they should be able to cope with the amount of tables they have?\nOn checkout we were charged for a dog and it soon became clear reception had got the wrong room.\nWe did feel that maybe we had been given a room for dog owners and were annoyed we had paid Travelzoo for a first floor room.    We may be wrong and maybe all the rooms were the same, although our room looked nothing like the lovely rooms on the website, but surely it\u2019s not wise to put people without dogs in a room that had clearly had a dog in it.

The bedroom was well appointed and the bathroom was clean. The only complaint about the facilities in the room was that, in common with many hotels, there was nowhere that someone who is short sighted could put on make up, as the bathroom mirror had the basin in front of it and the one in the bedroom was over the dressing table. The food at the evening function we attended was good.\n\nNow the problems - the water in the en suite was no more than a trickle and like other reviewers, we had trouble having sufficient water pressure to flush the toilet. The function in the marquee was spoiled because it was much too cold. Even after we put our coats on, it was uncomfortable, (at an estimate under 60 degrees). 3 tiny electric radiators for a marquee in October, especially when the door is constantly being opened, is completely inadequate. If this is to be hired at any season apart from high summer, then significantly improved heating is necessary. People like to dress up for special occasions and 'posh' clothes are rarely thick but I would still have been chilly in thermal trousers and fleece. Breakfast was also disappointing. For the quality that the hotel aspires to be I would expect fresh fruit to be on offer. The butter (no alternative spread) was rock hard and thus unspreadable. No decaff coffee, or choice of teas available - it may well have been had I asked and decaff coffee was available in the room. Breakfast began at 8am and all the cooked items were cold by 8.10am, despite being removed for reheating they were little better afterwards - I've no idea what they might have been like by the time breakfast ended at 10am. We were also initially charged the incorrect amount for our stay.",3,negative

We checked and thankfully were booked in, but had been missed off the seating chart. The room was full of large round tables that seated about 10 people, although they were very squashed together so difficult for people to get through between them. We were sat on a small table of 4 in the corner, with another couple who also weren\u2019t on the seating plan (and they\u2019d earlier met a party of 12 who also hadn\u2019t been named on it!) Now not being on the seating plan didn\u2019t bother me really, but being shoved on a tiny table that seemed to have been an after thought, with other guests having lovely place cards and us having nothing at all, just felt really poor for the price of the ticket we paid.\n\nThe staff were all very friendly, although it did seem as though a number of them were new as service was often slow. Food was very nice and had no issues with this.\n\nSome of the points to improve around the hotel itself:\n- no full length mirror in bedroom\n- heating system was extremely noisy and woke us at about 6:30am; due to the noise we struggled to get back off to sleep\n- ran out of wine glasses in the evening so had to reuse our previous ones, despite ordering different wines\n- email confirmation of booking had 2 separate check in times (2pm and 3pm) noted and it stared check out was 10:30pm but info in room said 11am (not a major issue, but little things like that should be right!)\n- told good WiFi in all bedrooms, but couldn\u2019t locate the WiFi from our bedroom half the time and when we could it kept cutting off due to lack of signal\n- signposting the exit from the car park would be useful as we tried to come out the way we\u2019d come in until we saw the no entry signs and had to turn around and go back again\n\nAll in all, a number of little niggles and feeling a bit like a hindrance at the dinner means we probably wouldn\u2019t return here.",3,negative

That they provided large bottles of Neal's Yard shampoo and soap etc. These were available for purchase if you wished. They provided the large bottles to protect the environment. We also noticed the water provided for drinking in our room came in glass bottles and had been bottled by the hotel. The publicity also said that they were growing their own vegetables,on arrival we were given a packet of their home made flapjacks.We were told that when the owners took over they had replaced all the beds. Unfortunately the one we slept in was too firm for me but I am sure others  would have liked it. We did have one unfortunate experience in that there was an unpleasant smell in the bathroom but as we were only staying for two nights we did not report it until we left and the very nice receptionist was going to contact maintenance so we are sure this would be fixed. \nWe had the five course tasting menu and all my courses were fine gluten free and vegetarian my husband was not so lucky as his lamb rump was too tough. We found by the time we had got through the five course we were full. We did find it difficult to understand some of the staff their English was perfect but we still did not understand. We enjoyed the breakfast both days and the lady there was really lovely. On the first day she even made me a fruit salad to go with my yogurt which she found for me. We found check in and check out staff very easy to understand and friendly. . We enjoyed our stay very much and felt it a privilege to sit in the lovely garden in February.",5,positive

However, this proved to be a facade in comparison to our room, number 22. \nI cannot comment on the food, as we did not dine here. Room 22... certainly a room with a view, what an experience! Still trying to comprehend how this room, which apparently was.... \""a complimentary upgrade to one of our dog friendly suites which has direct access to the garden area,\"" not only cost an extra \u00A325 but was clearly not the \""upgrade\"" stated, a \""downgrade\"" is a more accurate description. Unless we were expected to throw our dog out of the window, there was no other direct access to the outside. This room was dingy and drab. The decor and furniture was very tired and shabby in both the bedroom and bathroom. This made it feel dirtier. The upholstered chair should be removed due to the heavy soiling on it, very unpleasant. There were multiple iron burn marks on the carpet, many cobwebs, possible water marks on the ceilings, rusty radiator and the toilet flushed sporadically. The glass bottle of water was chipped on the rim (germs) and if wanted, I could purchase this bottle for \u00A34.00. We were not offered any complimentary flapjacks, as stated.\nNow the view... gosh! Our view was of various sheds\u002Fdustbin storage, so we witnessed a number of staff emptying bins or getting food out of, I assume, the freezer. Around 9am, the food waste lorry arrived to empty the commercial waste, which parked right outside our window, the smell was awful. In our opinion, this room was not worthy of the cost and should in fact be kept unavailable until refurbished, which is urgently needed! \nWe were surprised to see discarded old furniture (settee, mattress etc.) within the extended area for walking your dog. Not a pleasant sight and definitely not necessary.\nWe understand Tudor Hopkins would like Stanton Manor to be the \""jewel in the crown,\""  but our experience here has been a very unpleasant one, certainly not the gem of an experience we had hoped!

Both of which were lovely and a little filling as they were large portions, I left some of mine in anticipation of the meal to come. We both had the 8oz sirloin steak which was not only very tasty but also cooked to perfection for us both. I like mine medium to well done and my husband likes his medium, they were both spot on which we have found a rarity these days when eating out. Home made chips (which were truly scrummy by the way) fried onion rings, salad, mushroom and beef tomato all went perfectly with the steak. Again a large dinner and I reluctantly had to leave some because there was no way I was going to miss out on a pudding! We both had the chocolate sponge covered in a Baileys & Brandy sauce which was absolutely lip smacking. We stayed for coffee and brandy afterwards and apart from the fact they didn't have brandy glasses, saucers and spoons with the cups or any sweetener (which I am sure will be sorted soon) it was all very nice and a great end to the evening. We both feel that this is a place well worth keeping an eye on and looking forward to perhaps going there for lunch now and again too. One minus though was that the wine selection was a bit limited and there was no wine list either to chose from. We have however been told by the new owners that this is one of the improvements they intend to make within the next few weeks.  I will not go into any of the other little minuses of this place as like I said before, they are only wrinkles and easily ironed out with a little effort and some minor changes. Their lovely young staff were attentive, lively and all smiles, they are clearly going to be one of their biggest assets especially with a bit more training. Anne and David were warm lovely people who seem intent on turning this place around, my husband and I are very much looking forward to seeing this place unfold over the next few months. All in all a very nice place with a warm welcome, good food, good atmosphere and if the restaurant is anything to go by, I would think a great place to stay as well. We will definitely be returning again and would recommend to anyone to give this place a go.",5,positive

The hotel itself was fine - usual comfy beds, clean rooms and pretty much what you\u2018d expect.\n\nWe took the \u2018Meal Deal\u2018 which involved \u2018enjoying\u2018 breakfast and evening meals at the adjacent Brewers Fayre.\n\nTip 1: Unlike (I\u2018m certain) at other chains, with which Premier Inn partners - the Meal Deal in this location offers nothing in the evenings for Children accompanying paying Adults - therefore, our 14 year old was charged Adult prices for her evening meals - which somewhat eroded the value of taking the Meal Deal. It was also noted that the most expensive of all the items chosen were those billed. Hmmm.\n\nTip 2: If dining on the Meal Deal - then ensure that you mention this before ordering. We didn\u2018t, and the server then needed to cancel and re-order the entire meal a second time. The staff also seemed rather confused as to why we wanted to order 3 meals, whereas there were only 2 of us on the Meal Deal (Hint: Because, our 14 YO daughter got free breakfasts in any case...) - on the first evening this meant that it took the best part of 15 mins to place the order. Oh, yes - and it\u2018s all payment at the bar, up front.\n\nTip 3: Decline side orders: Onion rings - \u00A31.99 for TWO rings. Mushrooms - \u00A31.99 for 10 button mushrooms. Bargain!\n\nTip 4: Seriously - consider taking your own mugs for hot drinks at breakfast. On both mornings that we were there, the mugs ran out, and took an age to be replenished. Just buy more mugs, already!\n\nThe staff in general, appeared rather harassed and overworked - I suspect that there were not really enough of them rostered. Not their fault.\n\nIn conclusion, I realise that it\u2018s not Premier Inn\u2018s issue and that this review has been much more about the catering venue than accommodation per se - but the partnership with Brewers Fayre in this particular location would actively motivate us to look elsewhere to stay on a return visit.",3,negative

In this day and age isn't it about time Premier Inn had Twin bedrooms rather than one in a King Size bed that can't be split, the other person on what is at best described as a small sofa with bed made up on it, so hard didn't get a winks sleep on the two nights we stayed. Was told at reception they don't have twin rooms as such and in future to ask for a quilt to be wrapped around the sleeping surface to try and make it a bit more comfortable. Given up purchasing breakfasts at Premier Inn as you can always get far better and so much cheaper in any other Cafe\u002Fsupermarket etc, it's not that well presented, doesn't have what we asked for so again, brought our own cereal and milk and ate out later as required. Bathroom is fine, towels have been cut back from 2 bath Towels and 2 Hand a Towels to just one of each between two people. Talk about money pinching. The standards with regards to charges have really dropped in our opinion, the refurbished Travel Lodges are now tapping at Premier Inns door and over \u00A310 a night cheaper minimum. Plenty of free car parking here, and a Morrison fuel station and supermarket on opposite junction of roundabout. Beds are just covered over, no remake or straightening of bottom sheet. I could go on but won't.\nOn second visit we had the quilt wrapped around the base of sofa which is used as a bed even for a adult, and was more comfortable but how anyone is expected to get a good nights sleep in this I don't know. The free internet although welcome is just far to slow and limiting, it is far easier and quicker to connect to the 4G on my phone. The 40\"" TV is good and at a reasonable height, but you really need more than one PowerPoint at side of bed.\nThird visit was as good as it was going to get here, avoid if you can, very noisy, but that's down to families and their uncontrolled kids.\nStaff try to be helpful, but can be slow, this last visit wasn't on ground floor or a twin as booked but on next floor as a double. Waited to get relocated and room sorted, done eventually but just generally shows the very poor management of this particular Premier Inn. If they are all going for penny pinching now, they will find less customers and many more claims for bad nights. Didn't bother reporting faults with room on our last visit, but now have found a much better establishment to use in the future when in Wiltshire. No lifts in building if you are disabled or have problems with stairs.  Paintwork mouldy and discoloured in bathroom, poor cleaners.  Avoid if comfort is important to you.",2,negative

Really pleased, till we went for our meal.  Because we had travelled over 4 hours to get to Premier inn, we didn't want to travel again to eat, so booked the Brewers Fayre, which was recommended by the hotel. What a mistake that was.

After taking us to our seats, I asked if we could order drinks, and we were directed to a log line at the bar.......

When we queried the staff, we were told that since the 'living wage' was introduced they had to lay off 15 staff members!!!!!!!

Large tables have had 'Reserved' signs on them each day but in 3 mornings weve never seen anyone sit at them. Each morning the juices have ran out and we have had to request they are refilled. Each time 1 carton of juice is poured into the jug for it to be emptied 30 seconds later by thirsty customers, this is an hour and a half before breakfast service closes. Both coffee machines stopped working this morning, one ran out of milk and the other needed the coffee grinds emptying. Again we had to ask a member of staff to do this as there was a queue of customers waiting for a warm drink with their breakfast.

I checked in online which was supposed to save time when I arrived, but the machine didn't produce my room 'key' (card) so human intervention was needed. So - not much point to the online check in .... \nThe room itself was clean and pleasant, very comfortable bed. The bathroom was spotless and looked as if it was newly refurbished. It was very warm overnight; the window only opens a very small amount - necessary for safety, and a small fan was provided in the room. I'm glad I wasn't staying last week in the very hot weather. My room (120) overlooked the back of the Brewer's Fare buliding and there was a lot of noise from their air con\u002F fan outlets (?) so I had to close my window to get to sleep. I also had an unlovely view of the bins !!\nThe main corridors look like they could do with freshening up . \nThere is no lift up to the first floor - hard work if,as many travellers do - you are lugging heavy suitcases. When I queried this at reception I was told that a lift wasn't deemed necessary as there was 'only one floor upstairs, and the building is 15 years old' .... \nThe PI is badly let down by the adjacent Brewer's Fare. I arrived mid evening after a long drive so didn't feel up to venturing elsewhere for a meal. The staff are friendly and helpful, but 2 of the staff serving were clearly inexperienced and the service was very slow. I ordered steak and although I wasn't particularly in a hurry I had to ask a couple of times if my order was on its way. When it came the meal was barely wam and rather underwhelming... \nBoth the exterior and interior of the building are shabby and outdated. Outside there are weeds all around it and a very tatty looking children's play area. Inside many of the seats are shabby and stained. It all needs at the very least a good clean, but really a total refurbishment. I prepaid for breakfast, and it wasn't bad, just didn't want to linger in this dingy environment.\nSo in summary - the Premier Inn is good value, and in a convenient location but request a room on the ground floor if you're not feeling particularly fit. Avoid the Brewer's Fare if you can ....",4,positive

The hotel is on the outskirts of the town and is quite close to the M4 motorway which was our reason for choosing this it as we wished to break up a long journey. The hotel was easy to find and there is plenty of free parking on site.\nWe had checked in online, however, the machine in the lobby that is supposed to issue keys to those who have checked in wasn\u2019t working properly, fortunately, a member of staff was able to rectify this situation promptly, we were told that it was not uncommon for the machine to fail to operate. First impressions of our room were good \u2013 clean, well maintained, a reasonable size and with all the standard amenities that one expects to find in a Premier Inn bedroom. Unfortunately, things went downhill a little when we discovered that the toilet didn\u2019t flush and there was no hot water. My husband went to reception to report the problem and was told that the water had been turned off in order to fix a plumbing problem but hopefully would be turned on again shortly. Whilst we realise that a plumbing issue can occur anywhere at anytime we feel that we should have been told of this on our arrival \u2013 it is not ideal to find the toilet will not flush after it has been used!. It is, of course, possible that the receptionist was just under the impression that it was just the hot water supply that was affected, however, as this type of problem could occur again I feel that management need to  train staff to find out full details of the nature of any problem and relay them promptly to customers. Fortunately, there was a large Morrison\u2019s supermarket just across the road from the hotel that did have flushing toilets and a plentiful supply of hot water (it also has a caf\u00E9). Unfortunately, one of the lamp- posts that illuminate the hotel drive was not working so it was a little difficult to see the pathway to the hotel exit, moreover, traffic entering the hotel may have found it difficult to see us!\nAfter our visit to Morrisons we returned to the hotel and thankfully the plumbing was fixed. We ate our evening meal at the on site Brewers Fayre restaurant which offers traditional pub type meals at reasonable prices. We noted that if you go early that it was possible to get some very good meal deals. The food was good and we both enjoyed our meals. \nOverall, this is quite a good Premier Inn but due to the problems we encountered can only be awarded 3 stars on this occasion, however, this would not deter me from staying here again should I be in the area in the future.",3,negative

After about 15 minutes we wandered outside to see if we could see anyone.\nWe saw the man who was meant to be on reception enjoying a cigarette with another man outside, obviously seeing that we wanted to be seen to. We were just ignored. \nWe asked the man if we could check out and he RUDELY answered 'If you look on the every door it says for you to leave the cards on reception'. We did so, and as we walked back to our car he just stood there looking at us, making us feel VERY uncomfertable. \nI'm sorry if we did miss these signs that were on 'every' door but I still don't think we deserve to be spoken to in such a rude and abbruptive manner. \nI suggest you teach your staff not to prioritise their nicotine habbits over their customers and teach them how to respect other people. I did not appreaciate how we were treated and for this reason we will not be returning. \nThank you to Sammy for making us feel so welcome in the beginning though. \nShame on those members of staff who think they're better than those who stay there.

Firstly they have a computerised check in service which I ended up having to get the lady at the check in desk to help me with  as work had booked my room and I didn't know the postcode used for the booking. In the end it would have just been quicker with the traditional process of a person checking you in. Your room key and food vouchers all get printed out of the machine.\nThe room itself was as expected, however mine in particular was tucked away in the corner of the hotel and had the slightest of damp smells to it. On top of this the shampoo dispenser was broken and a pain to get anything out of. Ultimately none of this massively affected my stay, its just not up to the standard I expect from them.\n\nThe one other thing to note is that if you book for a couple of nights but turn up a day later than arranged for instance, then your booking gets automatically cancelled. This happened to my mate and caused a right headache after a long day working. The staff were lovely and helpful and explained that the room was refunded, however we had to pay for another room.\n\nThe hotel has a huge car park and the Brewers Fayre is just a hundred yards away.\nThere is also free wifi. \nI recommend paying for the meal deal as the hot breakfast is buffet style so you can determine your own portions.

However i feel it only fair to give a balanced view of the accommodation and experience that we had. \nWe have stayed in numerous B&B's up and down the country over the years and it could be that we have become 'picky'. However i expect good value for money but sadly overall that is not what we got. We left feeling we wished we'd never bothered leaving home. \n\nOn initially arriving at the farm we were made to feel welcome as the owner had previously tried to contact us to let us know she was going out. The overall view of the exterior of the farm is one of peace and tranquility, a get back to nature feel with horses in stables and fields.On entering the accommodation into the lounge\u002F kitchen initial thoughts were it looked very nice and we felt we made a good choice. \n\nUnfortunately the further we walked into the accommodation that feeling didn't last for long. I could list everything that was wrong about the place but it would be a very long list and it would seem rather churlish of me. \n\nThe main negatives of are we walked in feeling we had arrived on the back of someone just leaving and the place had been given a quick once over and there was a serious lack of attention to detail. There appeared to be things left by previous guest\u002Fs. There was inadequate provision for belongings in the master bedroom. The wireless internet was very weak and couldn't be picked up. The only positive thing to say about the bathroom is the bath was spacious and there was hot water. Sadly it reminded us of a dingy football shower block. The towels looked old and felt hard so we went and purchased new ones. \n\nThe breakfasts were adequate portions on the first morning though unfortunately very dry. On the second morning i was so shocked by the' full' english breakfast that i took a photo. My partner took what bits he wanted off my plate to make a 'decent' breakfast for himself and the rest ended up in the bin. I had cereal and toast from bread that we'd purchased ourselves, as the breadcakes that had been left didn't look or feel fresh.\n\nIt maybe that we expected too much, but it's very rare that i have ever left a b & b accommodation feeling ripped off and wishing i'd stayed at home. One thing i must stress is it mentions on the website that the accommodation 'Stable Cottage' is suitable for people with mobility issues. However in my opinion the bathroom configuration renders this impractical for people with impaired mobility. The door opens against the bath making it difficult to get to the toilet, and the large bath with over shower has no handrails to enable people with mobility issues to access this safely. \n\nIt is a real shame as on the photos, the write up and few guest reviews it seems perfect. The positives are  the lounge is spacious, bright and airy, good kitchen facilitiies, comfortable double bed, spacious bath and hot water.  It has the potential to be a very good B&B it needs a serious step up in attention to detail and i would recommend the owners try living in the cottage for a few days to identify practical improvements that are required.",3,negative

Arrived and Joanne the owner was not about but a quick call revelled the stable was unlocked with the keys in the door. This is a self contained premises with 2 bedrooms having a double in one and a single bed in the other overlooking the stables themselves. Open plan Kitchen diner and a log burner. We dropped our things and then after meeting Joanne we went for dinner. Joanne seemed to be a really nice friendly person. On our return from dinner we noticed a loaf of bread was left out and it was 2 days out of date. It was an extremely hard uncut crusty loaf. There was some dust and cornflakes on the floor, the Bathroom smelt of damp the extractor fan was full of dirt and dust, and the toilet seat was ill fitting, the shower was not very powerful. \nThe Kitchen sink was brown with tea stains and there were some dirty utensils and a sponge.The Fruit in the bowl which we thought may also be for breakfast had been there a while. The oranges were so old that the peel had gone hard and the bananas going black. \nThis aside we then then found that the bedsheets were dirty and the pillow cases appeared to be soiled as well. I removed the pillow cases and turned the bedsheets over only to find this was stained on both sides. After a nights stay we felt we could not stay here for another 2 nights and in the morning when Joanne brought a breakfast which was very well cooked (Burnt), I explained to her some of the issues. \nShe immediately apologised about the bed sheets and offered to change them and also added that the bread had been frozen and taken out of the freezer. No note on it though, but I still felt it was inedible. I offered to pay for the night and call it a day and Joanne insisted that it was unacceptable and no payment required. We started to pack our things and decided to leave at least \u00A350 for the breakfast and nights stay even though my wife couldn't eat her breakfast, where there was a tremendous banging on the window at the Kitchen. I pulled the curtains back to see an angry man who said \""If your leaving you better leave like now!\"". \nWith this action I then decided that no money would be left and we packed our things. \nAs I was loading the car which was near to the front entrance of where Joanne lived the angry man appeared and then started to verbally abuse myself and my wife with rude hand gestures and swearing abusive language. We asked why this action and was told to go away not very politely. We were also called a few choice names which cannot be mentioned on this site. He didn't seem to be bothered about what kind of review I would add either. We were so taken aback by this that we left and stopped at the end of the drive and contacted booking.com as I was not prepared to pay for 3 nights, who advised that they had to contact Joanne to cancel the booking. After a while they confirmed the booking was cancelled and that Joanne was very apologetic. \nBecause my wife was so shaken and upset I contacted the police who took all the details and gave a reference number. They called back later that day to confirm some more details. \nIf criticisms cannot be taken then they are in the wrong business or will he abuse everyone who dares to criticise? The issues had been sorted out with Joanne and agreed that we would not stay so why did this person\u002Fher partner interfere?\""",1,negative

The owners are lovely and breakfast delicious. \n\nA couple of things I will mention:\n1) internet did not work most of the time and when it did, it was really slow. For me travelling from Australia, I found it hard to research the area and also stay in touch.\n2) We did get totally lost trying to find the property. We ended up stopping at the post office \u002F shop in Yatton Keynell and the staff there were amazing. A big shout to them who rang around to find where the property is and thanks to them for looking it up and giving us exact directions. It is only a 5 minute drive to the farm. You must try the sausage rolls and other goodies, delicious.\n3) the facilities were totally fine and we stayed four nights which was probably a little too much as the chairs were not entirely comfortable.

Do not believe I could find anything better in the area (see Best B&B for original comments). Am considering next year doing day trips from here to South Wales (it's about 90 minutes to Cardiff) as the standard is so much better than what's on offer over the border. And it's cheaper than many, too.\nThe rooms being painted white means you can see that they are spotlessly clean, which is important if umpteen people are using the same facilities. Loads of hot water too.\nSome tourist officials might think that the rooms being away from the house is a problem. Not so. We like the independence and once we've been shown where everything is and how the locks\u002Foutside lights work we don't want someone hovering. Kate does the business; she is very friendly and chatty but not overly so. One thing I had forgotten is that she does not take credit\u002Fdebit cards. \nIt  bucketed this time but large brollies meant there was no danger of getting wet when we went to the main house for breakfast. The car parking is within 15 yds of the door , and the rooms on the ground floor, so excellent for the elderly. The dining room has one long table so you inevitably get talking to any other guests - and discover that they are also on a return visit. And that says it all.",5,positive

Pretty little courtyard where the old coachhouse stables (now a bar) are open serving drinks to guests day and night. The restaurant food is silver service and first class we ate ther both nights in the end as we were so impressed the first night. Laycock village is very near by so we used our National Trust membership to park there for free and enjoy the abbey. this is a cute little village with lots of photo opportunities don't miss a visit to the village hall where crafts and cakes are always on offer. Very helpful staff. There is no air conditioning so it does get very hot on the top floor and there were not enough electric fans to go around but they did try very hard to find one for us.

I say most, but more of that later!\nWe were comin to Wiltshire for a friends anniversary celebration in the local area, and having lived in the area a few years ago we decided to stay in Corsham. Our friends recommended the hotel and having looked at their website we decided to book. Then we made our first mistake- DON'T FOLLOW YOUR SAT-NAV!!!! This will take you down a road behind the hotel from which you cannot get to the hotel. Stay on the A4 and wait for the brown sign.\nUpon arrival we had a warm and friendly greeting and just felt relaxed and at ease from the start. The rooms were stylishly decorated, albeit a little cold upon arrival, however after asking reception we were assured they would warn up. They did so it was not a big deal. I figure in the cold weather this week it would happen at the best of places.\nThe week we stayed appeared quiet, however the waitresses in the evenin assured us they had quite a few conferences that week, and also enlightened us to just how deceptively big the place is. And this brings me on to the meal...\nWe ordered off the fine dining menu as we decided that as we were stayin two nights it would be a very expensive stay, and we had the anniversary meal to attend the next day. The food was excellent to say the least. I could go on about the dishes we had, however everybody has different tastes so please do try everything you can. Obviously not all at once, but do push the boundaries and try items that usually you wouldn't. The portion sizes were perfectly proportioned, and the dessert is well worth opting for. The chef deserves a Michelin star because all the dishes complimented each other. After we had finished there was no offer of coffee, and tbh this put a slight dampner on the evening, but we went back to our room and used the facilities there. Maybe the waitresses need training in upselling, instead of talking quite loudly about getting home early and how to set up for breakfast quickly. This made us, and another table we were talking to feel awkward. The manager Gary told us when we asked we could have had courses off of either menu- but this was after we'd eaten!\nNext morning we came down relatively early for breakfast and saw what we assume were regular businessmen eating already. The waitress quickly greeted us, took coffee orders and showed us to our table. The buffet on offer was adequate, however I felt from my personal choice it would gave paid to have had individual potion packs of the cereal as I had no idea how long it had been in the bowls. The home made yogurt was smooth and creamy without being too heavy. Strangely the orange juice had seemed to separate in the jug, but still tasted ok. I figure it was the heat in the room causing the bits to settle?! Once our coffee was out with ample amounts of toast we ordered hot food. I had the eggs Benedict on the recommendation of the waitress and it was exceptional! As too was the salmon my husband had. It was refreshing to hear the waitress having conversations with guests, obviously regulars, whilst still being aware of the needs of us and others. She even had a laugh and a joke with us too. No snobbery from such an upmarket hotel, totally opposite from the serving staff the night before. I was concerned however to hear she'd recently had a back operation, and this showed through considerable pain on her face when bending, walking or cleaning tables. She assured us and the gentleman who appeared to be a regular that she was ok, and never stopped smiling. She was constantly attending our needs, as too was the older waitress with her hair on top of her head. She stopped to give us advice on parking for later, and although appearing grumpy really wasn't, and it was nice to be treated like a person rather than a customer, if that means anything nowadays. Our pkates were cleared quickly without us feeling rushed, as too were our cereal bowls when our hot food arrived. I then heard a conversation I felt utterly dismayed and upset by, and not on my behalf. The waitress and another young gentleman had a discreet 'chat' about lunch service and it was mentioned that another member of staff staying on might be beneficial, admittedly I was eavesdropping, but I am fascinated by the workings of hotels. I was impressed that young staff could be thinking ahead regarding the business not going home! Then another member of staff started saying loudly how the breakfast waitress shouldn't be here if not fit to work, shouldn't be using her back as an excuse and even said she shouldn't be here at all! Despite hearing this and being visibly upset to which we even asked if she was ok, our waitress kept smiling and acted with utmost professionalism. This ruined our last morning, after an otherwise almost perfect stay. If the manager reads this, which I doubt they will, perhaps you should train the staff in discretion and also commend the breakfast waitress!\nThe best points were: the eggs Benedict, the fabulous evening food, the Marlborough Sauvignon blanc is exceptionally beautiful and well worth the price tag. The friendliness of all staff to guests, beautiful ground and even the ducks that chased us to our car!\nDownsides: staff discretion, information to diners, toilets for dining room being a long walk away, salt and pepper mills being hit and miss on working, rooms a little tired around the edges.",4,positive

Just off the main Bath Road, it's a great location for visiting Bath and nearby Corsham.\nWe had Room 21 in the garden annexe; it's a small but comfortable room on the ground floor, with a lovely view - not overlooked by other rooms but anyone wandering in the gardens could see in (not a problem for our midweek stay when there weren't that many other guests but could be an issue if there was a busy function on). Plenty of wardrobe space but only room for one bedside table (annoying). Bathroom was small but clean with shower and tiny bath. Complementary hand wash, shower gel and shampoo were good quality although I personally didn't like the fragrance (too fruity - smelt like jelly beans)!\nDinner was included in our package on the first night so we dined in the restaurant - a pleasant series of rooms, overlooking the croquet lawn and pond. Choosing two courses from the set menu we decided to go for starters and mains. With 2 AA rosettes, we were expecting a treat but, sadly, we were a bit underwhelmed - husband thought that just three small tiger prawns were a bit stingy for his starter, his lamb was chewy and a little overdone and the fondant potato wasn't very nice. I chose the duck and foie gras rillettes as a starter but didn't think it was really worth the supplement.  I had whole plaice for my main course which looked overcooked when it came out but was actually OK.  The A La Carte Menu looked interesting and we may have been tempted to try it on the second night but, after our disappointment and despite the incentive of a free glass of wine,we decided to go elsewhere.\nIf you don't mind a bit of a walk, Pickwick is about 20 minutes away and Corsham, with a good selection of pubs and restaurants, is only 15 minutes further (if you don't fancy the walk back, a cab from the taxi rank outside the Co-Op will cost about a fiver). Bath is only 8 or 9 miles away and you can get a bus from the main road at the bottom of Guyers Lane.\nBed was extremely comfortable and we slept really well on both nights. It was very quite and peaceful, with no traffic noise as you are well away from the main road - maybe not the case when there's a function on though, so check when you book.\nThere was plenty of choice for breakfast - we both went for the full English on the first morning but again we weren't particularly impressed; not very generous servings and I didn't like the sausage at all. The next day we both had smoked salmon and scrambled egg, which was absolutely delicious - the best scrambled eggs I've had for ages. The eggs Benedict looked good too.\nOverall we enjoyed our stay here and thought it was good value for money.",4,positive

Whiled away a perfect summer morning after Eggs Benedict, strolling in the gorgeous gardens and sitting by the pond being confused about a strange looking fish which turned out to be a not-yet-finished frog. It's hard not to feel as though you're in an Evelyn Waugh Novel sipping a G&T out on the terrace listening to nothing more than the distant clink of glasses and the birds singing. Our room was beautiful and tidy and the four-poster bed incredibly comfy. It's only a short and picturesque drive out through the country to take in a White Horse or two then down to that Medieval town, Lacock which has some super pubs (and it's where photography was invented, which is why Milenna found it so funny that we couldn't buy a disposable camera there), before coming back for a delicious evening meal (good chef and varied menu). The staff are un-intrusive, yet very helpful, and bang on their jobs. Sophie and Agnes, a special thanks for making dinner such a joy. All our needs were met to perfection. Maybe we just picked the perfect weekend, but I doubt it. It would be an absolutely rotten kind of person who didn't succumb to the romance that comes floating up from the rose garden and in through the bedroom window on the early evening breeze at Guyers House.

The service was always friendly but also professional. The wine list might benefit from a few half bottles (something of a rarity these days) for single travellers - possibly hoteliers feel that couples might, God forbid, order a half rather than a full bottle. There were however reasonable wines by a variety of glass sizes. I notice a comment about drink prices in an earlier review but my local pizzeria (in the North of England) is more expensive in this respect for similar wines. The gardens were immaculate and interesting, the hedges were stunning. A lot of atmosphere, a proper dining room (actually three connecting rooms with a garden views) with proper linen and good glasses, a good seating area in reception and a very pleasant lounge with plenty of country-house sofas and armchairs made this a very pleasant place to stay. The order for my morning paper miscarried but a replacement was quickly found (just glad that no-one saw me reading the Telegraph rather then The Times). Furnishings in my room were pleasingly non-standardised ie real pieces of furniture rather than fitted junk; there was a good TV and a proper desk lamp and a proper desk. There was plenty of storage space and good bathroom and a comfortable bed. The car park was very large.

Our very comfortable bedroom mixed green furnishings with blue drapes and curtains and the bath was old and narrow in a very quirky arrangement that could easily have been transformed into a luxurious  space. The restaurant lacks atmosphere with overly bright lighting and due to the lack of background music, everyone speaks in hushed tones, and the staff although attentive enough seem inexperienced and unpolished .\n\nBut that is the downside - the food in the restaurant was fabulous. The steak was melt in the mouth perfect, the peppercorn sauce was tangy and had bite. I had a superb orange panna cotta and the cheese board was perfectly pitched.

We had upgraded to a superior room and were glad we had as the room itself was lovely and the view over the gardens stunning. We were greeted with cocktails and canap\u00E9s on arrival which was a nice touch. We were lucky the weather that weekend was warm and sunny so we sat in the garden for a few pre dinner drinks. On our first night we ordered from the set menu and were both pleased to be able to select something different as the menu was quite varied. Service at dinner was very efficient and discreet, which is so unusual these days. On our second night we decided to eat from the a la carte menu, which was wonderful. My partner ordered the steak and considered it to be the best he has had and believe me we eat out a lot both here and abroad. The service was impeccable and having stayed at The Savoy on several occasions I complimented the manager on his staff as they could have been Savoy trained they were that good. The location is great as we visited the Swindon designer outlet on the journey down, Lacock Village on the Saturday (which is well worth a visit) and Bath on the Sunday, all within easy reach of the hotel. It was such a pleasure to have a wonderful weekend away where we didn't even have to complain once, which makes a change from some of our breaks at Marriot Hotels.

So far so good, The problems started in the restaurant(which was as quiet as a doctors waiting room) when somebody else was on the table we had reserved, I ordered the Pork which was overcooked and tough with a blunt knife to saw through it. We orderd a side plate of veg which consisted of half a carrot and a tiny portion of runner beans( which we later found we had been charged \u00A33.95 for). The portions were so small at 9.00 we orderd a chinese to be delivered,and the next day we got some cheese and biscuits in to have after our dinner. Breakfast at this hotel is ample with a good selection and cooked to our liking.Overall the hotel side is good and the saff can't do enough for you, but the dinners are frugal and not worth the extra money charged, WATCH OU FOR ADD-ONS, apart from the veg( which for me when you get a dinner as part of the deal should be included) they added nearly \u00A310 service charge ( which I refused to pay).

We stayed for two nights, offer included one nights 2 course dinner from the Table D'h\u00F4te (TDH) menu. Hotel is beautiful, built of the local honey coloured stone and set out around a number of courtyard areas. Accommodation is very tasteful, rooms are not overly large but are adequate and kept clean, although carpet in the room in which we stayed could do with replacing. Bathroom is large and had facilities for less mobile guests. Grounds of the hotel are lovely and very pleasant to walk in, they are also exceptionally quiet, we couldn't hear any noise at all considering the proximity to the main A4 road. Only disappointment was guests in adjoining rooms were smokers and the noise of doors slamming shut early in the morning whilst they took their first drags of the day meant that an early morning lay-in was not possible!\n\nThe best parts about this hotel has to be the staff and food. There are both TDH and A la carte menus, we chose from the excellent choices on the more restricted TDH and were not disappointed, food was of excellent quality and very well cooked. We decided after such an excellent meal the first night to eat in the hotel again on the second night. Breakfast was equally excellent and sufficient to last most of the day. The staff are excellent and have a lovely attitude to their tasks, nothing was too much trouble and there was always a happy smile to greet you whether from the restaurant manager or the cleaning staff, well done!\n\nHotel is convenient to visit local attractions we went to both Bath and Lacock, and would recommend both these beautiful local locations.",4,positive

Although the menu being served wasn't the same as advertised on there website and on the night a a lot  of the dishes had extra price supplements ,which wasn't the end if the world but , maybe a bit cheeky though !!

Not greasy or oily !! Very tasty , rooms were cosy not small , clean and the bed was really comfy !! We had a garden room with a shared entrance , it's just a shame that the next door room occupants were more interested in smoking in the hallway every 20mins from 5.30am rather than sleeping like normal people  !! And weren't really bothered about waking the rest if the hotel up by smoking us out and slamming doors !! But obviously the hotel can't help these sorts !!! Would definately return and it's literally 10-15mins from bath so we had a good day shopping and visiting the Roman baths !!! Was a lovely  relaxing weekend away !!! \n",4,positive

Dinner, a seven course affair created by Gareth and his team using fabulous produce from Glen's garden with immaculate wine pairing by Vincenzo, was stupendous. The venue, the Ball Room (which is more of a Baronial banquet room), be-decked in flowers and twinkling with candles was a perfect location.

I will mention the fact that only one Hand towel is supplied, I had previously noticed a few comments about this, and I would suggest if you are providing a double room for double occupancy it would be nice to have another hand towel. (I actually brought my own having read the previous comments). \nWe ate from the Fine Dining menu every evening and this did not disappoint! The food was beautiful!  The starters were of a good portion size, definitely enough and the mains again were satisfactory. Gosh the bar is expensive! \u00A37 for a glass of Sauvignon Blanc is quite excessive, so we refrained from using the bar more than we needed to. Breakfast is equally good with a plentiful range to choose from. (The cooked breakfast is lovely).  I found the tea to be weak, even using the egg timer multiple times so I had coffee for the next two mornings.  \nService: Impeccable! cannot fault one bit, the staff are absolutely wonderful! Friendly, nothing is too much trouble, and extremely polite. Well done Guyers! \n\nThe whole feel of Guyers is relaxed rather than stuffy, and we loved our stay.  \nWoud we return?  Absolutely! \nWould we Recommend? Definitely! (Use the Secret Escapes Deal for good value)",5,positive

The room was quite small with a standard double bed and an odd tall chest of drawers inside the wardrobe cupboard which left little pace for hanging clothes.  It was fine for one night but any more would have felt a little cramped.  The bathroom was nice with a good bath and shower, plenty of towels and toiletries but no cups for toothbrushes or a drink of water in the night which I would normally expect in a hotel.  We had 2 courses from the Fine Dining menu but I agree with other reviewers that phrasing it as \""I will show you what you are entitled to\"" is a bit odd.  My husband paid the supplement for the steak which was lovely and came with chunky chips which wasn't stated on the menu so we ordered fries which we did not need.  I had the duck which was lovely if a little salty.  We both had the carrot and cumin soup which was lovely but we needed to add a lot of salt (one extreme to the other).  The grounds were nice with a couple of nice ponds and a lawn.  We did not use the bar - it looked very old fashioned as did the drawing room - sort of pastel furniture from the 80's.

The driveway, gardens and external appearance of the hotel lived up to those expectations, but the internal aspects were not quite so good. Everything was spotlessly clean and perfectly pleasant, but it all felt a little dated and tired. Our room had a lovely view over the garden, but the bathroom was tiny, with old fittings, and the bed could have benefitted from a new mattress. Nonetheless, the welcome was warm (although no help was offered in carrying our bags up the stairs to our room) and we were invited to have a glass of mulled wine in the bar. While this was a nice touch, mulled wine is not to everyone's taste and we felt an alternative--other than tea or coffee--might have been offered. And the bar itself was so depressing and dark--wood panelled walls with dark colour above, and silent, not encouraging the occupants to talk! Dinner was excellent, and the service good; we were, however, a little puzzled as to what system was used for seating people. There are three rooms, one of which seemed to be reserved for older people and one for a group, while the other seemed to be the location for younger folk. We were a little dismayed to find ourselves ushered to a seat with the old folk--and we had no indication of other possibilities until we saw other couples being escorted through to another room, which we discovered the following morning at breakfast to be bigger and brighter and rather more pleasant. While the dining experience was generally positive (a side order of fries did not appear with the main course until we had reminded the waiter), with really excellent cooking on show, the dining chairs were rather uncomfortable, catching one's legs at just the wrong place.\n\nWe had booked in advance and paid the usual rates; as we subscribe to Secret Escapes it was a little upsetting to see a special offer for the night we stayed--and obviously lots of other people saw it and took advantage as the hotel was practically full, with couples getting the same experience as us but for rather less.\n\nThis hotel has real possibilities--with work it could achieve real excellence; the food was verging on Michelin star quality, certainly, but there is much that could be done elsewhere in order for the reality to live up to what the website implies....",4,positive

When we arrived at the hotel tired and very full firstly it became pretty obvious that the reception manager did not have our booking on the computer and was not expecting us. Furthermore once our booking was found somewhere in the back office the reception manager told us that the \u00A330 credit was for a meal on the first night. However the manager was highly professional and whilst there was a slight panic in her eyes when she couldn't find the booking she outwardly was the embodiment of calm and we in fact received a free upgrade on the room. The manager also admitted that there was nothing on the paperwork to tell us that the credit had to be taken on the first night and so agreed that we could use it the next night and booked us in for 8pm the next evening. When we went for breakfast the next morning the waiter confirmed that we were booked in for dinner at 8pm, It was therefore somewhat of a surprise when we arrived at 8pm to find that the evening staff did not have our booking however again the waiter calmly found us a table and we had a lovely meal. When we arrived there was no mention of the free brownie and cocktail and there was a wedding reception going on so we didn't go around to the bar. Having missed out on our free cocktail we ordered a pina colada which was brought out to us and the barman explained that they usually only have a cocktail of the week and get in the ingredients for that cocktail and no other, they did not therefore have the proper ingredients and so he had improvised , I can honestly say that it was probably the nicest cocktail I have ever had. Later we went to the bar to get another drink and the barman then looked at his list and asked if we had been given our free cocktail and brownie the day before and when we said not he immediately got us one. To cap things off when we came to check out and pay there were 3 drinks and two sandwiches on our bill from the Friday night which we had not ordered as we had literally gone straight up to the room once we had booked in and didn't come out until the next morning, I pointed this out and after a quick check confirmed that they had gone on the wrong bill and took them off. All this sounds like a catalogue of errors but I was very impressed that they were all dealt with quickly with a minimum of fuss and we did not in anyway suffer or have our time spoiled.\nThe hotel was lovely with beautifully kept gardens and the food both in the evening and at breakfast superb. I would thoroughly recommend the hotel and there were different guests from the wedding party (mostly 20s and 30s) through to more senior couples and families with young children.",5,positive

Staff were attentive without hovering, we didn't feel rushed at all but at the same time we weren't kept waiting even for a moment. Our drinks were kept topped up, and if we ran out of anything we were asked if we wanted more.\nThe food itself was delicious, in particular the chocolate mousse dessert - I honestly think it was the best dessert I've ever had in my life.Even the after dinner coffee (which was served in the comfort of the lounge) came with a little pot of melted chocolate and some fruit to dip. The whole evening was so decadent and very special. Staff in the bar were very friendly, and there was music playing loudly enough that you could hear it but no so loudly that it interrupted the conversation.\nBreakfast the next morning was excellent, with a range of hot food and a cold buffet available. The eggs royale in particular was delicious, although quite a large portion, so really it was more like a brunch for us than a breakfast.\nThe breakfast was better on the Sunday morning than on the Monday, although still very good, so we wondered if there was a different chef at the weekend to during the week.\nThe hotel is in a good location, with some nice pubs nearby if you don't want to eat in the restaurant - we went to the Hare & Hounds, and enjoyed it a great deal. Huge portions!\nThere was a guide in the room that summarised some of the places nearby, so we went to the village of Lacock, where filming has taken place for several movies and TV shows, from Harry Potter to Pride & Prejudice. Lacock Abbey was very interesting, and well worth a day out.\nWe would definitely stay here again.",5,positive

This is a pretty house in lovely, well-kept gardens- very pleasant to wander about with croquet and tennis to enjoy if so inclined.  Pleasant lounge and smart, welcoming dining room.\n\nIn brief: positives and negatives:\n\nWe had a good size room in the main house, overlooking the garden (and slight shame but understandable, marquee) - nice view from bed onto huge tree.\nVery comfortable large bed with lovely bedding.  Good bedside lamps - not always the case for reading.\nTV and tea facilities.  Dressing table\u002Fdesk but mirror no good for make-up as tv in front of the mirror.\nNice fireplace preserved in room and good wardrobes but 80s\u002F90s \""antique pine\"" bedside table freestanding inside to provide drawers in the room.\n Bathroom very clean and appeared new tiles etc. but felt needed updating - not in terms of tatty fittings but just old style and not old in nice old house, vintage look.  No mixer tap and hot tap scorching so almost unusable. Shower very weak in output.  Toiletries unimpressive - bath\u002Fshower gel glooped into bath, not foaming.\nOverall, a nice room but a few niggles.  Could be improved.\n\nStaff in restaurant and at reception were great - helpful and friendly.\nPaid supplements on first night for certain items on dinner menu and therefore disappointed when the tiny steak arrived thoroughly cooked through after asking for medium.  Replacement produced quickly and was absolutely delicious.\nWHilst we do not like rushing through fine meals, ours took almost 2 1\u002F2 hours as the wait for dessert was very odd.  This took up quite a bit of our evening!  \nOur second dinner experience started with superb starters - after the tiny portions of the previous evening, we were very pleasantly surprised by not only the lovely flavour combinations but also the quantity.  Excellent.  A great shame then when our identical main courses arrived and lacked much flavour at all.  The duck, pink as expected, was chewy and totally unenjoyable with no flavours on the plate to lift the situation.  I realised I was eating to be polite and gave up.  Desserts were very good indeed so we left on a high.  Inconsistent standards but our general impression was of a friendly small country house restaurant that potentially was excellent.\n\nDitto the hotel really - room keys are those cheap mulit-coloured tabs you use for the shed etc. - Not what you expect for a room in a lovely old house with a room rate of that amount.  Super gardening, good car park, very pleasant public rooms (lovely function room we spied also), great staff but a few things could be improved.  We are glad we went and loved exploring the area.  I would recommend it but always good to be aware of a few things you may not have expected.",4,positive

Things went downhill from there. The coffee was good but it took another 10 minutes for the cutlery and serviettes to arrive. As we had time to kill we went back outside but an hour later when we went back to the lounge no one had shifted our plates and cups. During the afternoon event that we attended, several trips to the bar meant hunting down the barman each time to get served as the bar was unmanned. Several wines were tried including a Pouilly Fuisse at \u00A333 a bottle over dinner. All were average to poor in quality which was a shame. Breakfast, (full English) was served with filter coffee which was at the opposite end of the spectrum to the one we had the afternoon before and was undrinkable. The sausages were uncooked and pink inside so left on the plate. To add insult to injury, I left my iPhone charger and cable behind in the room when we left. I phoned up when we got home and housekeeping had found it by the bed. They wanted to charge us the postage to send it back until I reminded them I had spent almost \u00A3300 for one night. It took them over a week to put it in the post and several chasing telephone calls, and then we found we had to pay an excess charge as the envelope had insufficient stamps on it. Eventually, it arrived some 2 1\u002F2 weeks later only to find it wasn't our charger and cable but a cheaper imitation. ENOUGH SAID.",2,negative

The bathroom light switch  - pull cord operated - felt  like it would fail any moment and one of the shelves  needed refixing.

We got on with it and had an ok sleep.\n\n We had been very excited about our day out on the Saturday and had a lovely time exploring the area.We returned to our rooms late afternoon  expecting the lights to be working , oh no Still NOT working . No explanation, nothing. I went to the reception as felt this was ridiculous.  Not one time did I get an apology , only to be told \"" I've just come back to the desk \"" and this is the man who we spoke to the day before about our problem with the lights.\n\nWe had been offered to move rooms buy no rooms together. I wanted to speak with everyone before agreeing to this so returned to our rooms. \nAbout ten minutes later the lights came on , hurrah. \n\nAll it would have taken was someone to come to us and apologies , maybe offer more lighting in our room, not that the lamp was very safe. \n\nMy husband checked us out the following day , he said he did get an apology  but in my opinion it was a little late. \n\nSadly this put a big downer on our   time we had at Guyers house, as it's  such a beautiful place ,  rooms are a little tired though,  bin in bathroom looks like it's had it a day. \n\nSo a 4 star property but not 4 star service.",2,negative

For sure the location is a delight, a large house with discreet annexes set in large fairly well-manicured grounds & very very quiet.   In theory - wonderful.\nThe welcome was warm as was every dinner main course, that\u2019s when it arrived.  One diner gave up waiting & went straight to the sweet.  Many diners had reason to return their food for one reason for another.  Those staying more than 4 nights were infuriated to be offered exactly the same dinner menu every evening.   Starters were perfect, shame that one evening a sweet was a joy the next evening the same sweet was like something ready-made from a supermarket.  The young waiters were lacking in confidence & obviously uncomfortable with having to deal with so many complaints.   One evening a deputy manager did make a brief appearance never to be seen again.  Perhaps this experience was a one-off as the regular chef was away & the replacement untried.   A carpet splattered with food & liquid stains was however inexcusable completing an unedifying dining experience. \nBreakfast was as interesting.  Taken in a sunny room it was a shame that views of the garden were obscured by window glass that had not seen water & a chamois for a long time. There was a modest choice from a self-service buffet but the cooked breakfasts were deliciously superb.\nThe room allocated was well furnished & a comfortable sleep was enjoyed.  \nFor some reason the charming characterful lounge furnished with an assortment of loose-covered sofas was never used by guests, probably because on the cool evenings experienced it was never heated & thus unwelcoming.   Or maybe not heated because it was never used! \nThroughout the hotel the woodwork is faded stained & chipped, in fact in places it\u2019s worn back to bare wood.  It was probably once white.  \nPerhaps these factors are of moderate import for the conference delegates or those attending a function at somebody else\u2019s expense, but the overall impression is of an hotel in some sort of difficulty because considerable time & expense is urgently needed to justify its 4 star catergorisation.\nAll so different from a visit some years ago.

The place itself looks quite impressive from the outside, and has a very quirky taste on the inside with all sorts of assorted objects and odd pictures\u002Fpaintings inside. \n\nI felt the staff service could have been a bit better -check-in was straight forwards, but was told my room is outside in the other building. Most places will actually escort you or offer to assist with luggage, but instead I ended up on my own spending a good five minutes trying to find my room due to the unusual layout. Part of the main building was undergoing refurbishment which added a whole load of noise and trailing cables around.\n\nThe bedroom itself was fine - the bed was comfy and all the usual amenities were available. As a recently refurbished part of the hotel, the place was clean and the bathroom was nice.\n\nThe bar and restaurant for me are the biggest let downs for this establishment. Firstly the bar had no drinks on tap, and charged a small fortune for small bottles of beer or glasses of wine. The bar is quite dingy in an underground cellar-style part of the building and doesn't make you want to stay very long. The bar staff were polite, but also doubled up as restaurant servers so weren't always available.\n\nThe restaurant itself had a very limited menu, with only approximately four to five different mains available. When looking at the menu on the first evening I was promptly informed that of the mains, one of them wasn't available as it was only for \""two people\"" as a minimum to eat. I believe they tout this approach as a \""fresh food\"" dining experience, but I felt it was overpriced and I couldn't find anything special about the food I was served. This was true at both dinner time and breakfast - where asking for something not explicitly printed on the menu is a no go. If you have to stay here for more than one night its probably better to simply go out for dinner somewhere else in Corsham where you can get better value for money and have more choice.",3,negative

Curtains were held up with string, there was no guest book indicating check out times, menus or any other general information you would expect in the most basic of hotel rooms. The Treetops apartments where we were placed meant that there was no possibility of room service and no phone to contact reception in the room.  There was however a naff selection of books which had a note warning you'd get charged if one went missing... They'd have to pay ME to steal one!!!

The grounds were very interesting with plenty of pigs, chickens  and other fowl. \nThe staff  were wonderful throughout. Although we were not in the main house,  the room was spacious and clean.

This place is all that and theoretically wonderful BUT a few things make it an absolute NO-RETURN for us. We booked the superior room which was in the main (old) building. The building, the setting in the park, the in-room decoration was very pleasant and just what we hoped for. However, the room had bird feces all over every window dripping down and obstructing the view to otherwise very beautiful view. There were piles of feces on every windowstill and railings. All absolutely disguasting (see pictures)! The pigeons are all there making noises, waking you up in the morning (we didn't mind but some guests might)... The room was also extremely stuffy because none of the windows could be opened! It was 27\u00B0C and sunny for the past 3-4 days and most likely well above 30\u00B0 inside the room. This is most likely also the reason why no one bothered to (or could easily) ever clean the windows!!! So no windows to be opened and no air con!

Just a hot, stuffy, dark \""superior\"" room! We were eventually offered a fan which while nice in theory was simply a loud way to circulate hot air. This is an absolute no-go!

So their customer service skills appear to be non-existent. I am not one for publicly humiliating an establishment in my reviews however this has to be passed on after not receiving any feedback. This review is going to sound very confusing as on one hand I couldn't fault the Hotel but yet on the other hand the part we stayed in was a little shocking.\nI would like to Thank The Rudloe Arms for our stay in such a lovely Hotel. We were both very impressed with the main hotel and its beautiful surrounding gardens. Lovely to see the animals they keep their and have a romantic walk with such lovely views.\nIts so nice to stay in a place with such style and class. Plus it was a pleasure to see the talented man behind it all at breakfast especially for someone who works in the industry and has closely followed his work.\nWe aren't from the area and were staying for a family reunion\u002Fmeeting that was a first for my family so meant a lot to me to go smoothly and remain relaxed, so I wasn't going to let anything ruin it. However I was extremely disappointed in the \""afterthought annexe\"" part of the hotel that we were put in for our stay. I appreciate the fact we knew we were going to be in there, what I didn't know was that it was going to be so rundown and disgraceful in terms of decor and care. How can the main part of the hotel be so impressive and this part so ignored. \nI noticed old signs from the last owners etc that indicated maybe Marco hadn't had it long and was still yet to put his stamp on this part of the hotel but after some research i'd come to the conclusion that in fact it's been 3 years so this wasn't an excuse. I just can't get my head around how they think its acceptable to book these rooms out when there are such extreme differences to the rest of the hotel decor and are left with the unfinished look, if this is the case then maybe they should reconsider booking them out until they are completed. When we go away we like to spend a bit more and stay in decent hotels but I'd rather of stayed in a travel lodge as to be honest they come at a lot higher standard and are a damn sight cheaper. I expect to have a lot more quality for my money, maybe a fridge, some water, real milk, maybe the opportunity to have room service, however there wasn't a phone, not a travel kettle, a bit of cleanliness, furniture that wasn't so random and that isn't broken, maybe a bit of character. There was no plug sockets near the mirror which was awkward when my partner was getting ready. The room and bathroom smelt a bit funny. There was also a disused unfinished bathroom in the room with a connecting door. We would of expected it to be a building that at least didn't look completely disjointed from the main hotel that makes you feel you're staying in a hostel compared. The other upside to our stay was a good breakfast but then that is to be expected in the Hotel of a famous chef. However the cold toast arrived 10 minutes after the breakfast did. I must also add the reception looks a bit make-shift, a table with a laptop in a room off the main hall with a girl sat at it with no indication its the reception.\nSuch a great shame that a nice hotel has been let down by its random extension and let downs. I think our stay could of been whole lot different and impressive had we been staying in the main hotel rooms. \nI can only give this an overall Average rating unfortunately.",3,negative

There  were also screws sticking out of the walls next to our bed, and we had a duvet cover as  thin as a blanket with no visible radiators.

This is the second time I have visited the Hotel and was so looking forward to the return stay as our first time was enjoyable. I booked late and asked for a deluxe room as the one we previously booked was from a Groupon deal and quite small with poor lighting at the top of the main house. The room we had on this trip was room number 3, light and airy and full of the usual quirky artwork. We had had a long drive so thought lets have a nice cup of tea, only to find no tea or coffee making facilities!!! so though ok lets pop down to the bar, only to find out that the bar that was there last year has been converted into a function room.  Went back upstairs and thought well we will just have to chill, watch a bit of news on the TV and look forward to our evening meal, only to discover there is no TV!!! (although website says TV in every room) We decided to kill some time and go for a walk as you can only sit in a chair looking at a wall for so long, good job it was not raining. The grounds are spectacular and I am sure in the summer you would not need a TV. \nThat evening we sat down for our meal and was again disappointed that two starters were not available, one of the main courses and one of the sweets. Bearing in mind we sat down to eat at 19:30 there was only 2 other tables occupied and all the others were set ready, I could not understand how from a menu offering approx 5 options on each course how when the hotel had such a low occupancy you could run out of food!! When the food did arrive I cannot fault it, it was as expected. Tasted excellent, presented well and ample portions. We left the restaurant and retired to our room and as there was no TV decided to have an early night only to be woken by dogs barking at 23:40 and running along the landing and again at 04:30 barking outside.\n\nDay two:- we went down for breakfast and was again unlucky as we had to suffer the sound of a screaming child throughout the meal\n\nEvening meal was an experience, we sat down only to see children running around the restaurant and coming over to our table and play with our candle, I explained to the head waited that if I wanted to dine an McDonald's I would have gone there, his response was he could not control other peoples children, we left and said we would return in 45min.\nOn our return we sat down and again the same with issue re choices on the menu being unavailable, How you can run our of Chips!!! I was offered \""bubble and squeak\"" instead also the french onion soup was not available so the waiter said the chef could make fresh pea soup instead. \n\nWe retired after the meal and again was forced to have an early night as there was no entertainment, no bar and no tv. We were again awoken by the sound of a car idling its diesel engine for 20min at 06:00 outside our bedroom window, I can only assume he was clearing the ice from his window and instead of scraping the ice as any other considerate person would do though he would wake everyone up!!!\n\nI honestly feel that I have been seriously short changed on this break, the \u00A3430 I paid for a 2 night stay was a lot considering what we experienced.

We were so surprised with how big our suite was and was very clean however my only criticism is it was cold and there were lots of stains on the floor and the decor wasn't anywhere near as impressive as the style in the main house.\nAfter relaxing in our room we headed over to the restaurant for dinner knowing it wasn't going to cheap as it was New Years Eve so we expected the service and food to be 5 star for Marco Pierre White - The food we couldn't fault but the service was possibly the WORST I have ever experienced in a hotel and we have been to ALOT of hotels in all sorts of durations... we were told to sit at the bar and read through the wine and food menu whilst our table was getting ready, it felt like 10 minutes before we were seated to an empty restaurant? we were seated on a table that allowed my husband and I to sit side by side rather than opposite (seems fun and different at first but after three hours our necks were sore from talking) whilst the other side of the room sat on normal two seater tables opposite each other.\nAnyways we were first served by a gentleman with big spiky hair and asked if we wanted a drink to which we replied to him that we were supposed to be having free glass of prosecco with our set menu but to leave the drinks menu in case we change our mind throughout the night. He gave us our drinks but took the drinks menu with him to which we shrugged that off as he might not of heard us. We looked at our menu and was disappointed with the lack of choice for \u00A355 pp, however a gentlemen who looked like the manager came to us and asked if we had any questions about the menu which was great.\nOur menu was taken down by a lovely young lady but when my husband asked for his steak to be served medium rather than the recommended medium rare serving suggestion we were shocked to be told no, my husband replied surely the chef could be cooked a minute longer on each side. She said she will talk to the chef to which he said that was fine, however the atmosphere seemed frosty after this. The starter was terrine and it was ok, I've had better. The wait for the main was ridiculous, 1 hour and 30 minutes from when we first ordered. Just as we were going to complain the meal came out, it was stunning (the steak was perfect as well as my venison). The dessert was also beautiful and came out swiftly after the mains.\nIt was time to pay for the bill which we decided to pay by cash rather than add it to the room, we noticed they charged us for the prosecco but after explaining yet again that we were told it was included, they re-did the bill and the waiter with the big spiky hair took our cash and we waited for about 15 minutes for our \u00A36 change. We were thinking of leaving it as a tip but my husband saw the waiter putting money in a jar by the bar and started serving other people!! We could believe it! He actually took our change for tip without asking us! My husband was fuming and told the waiter after waiting for his attention that we were still waiting for the change!! He seemed puzzled and said 'oh has she not given it to you yet?!' We said 'no why would she as you took the money!'. Next thing we heard was change being taken out of the jar and handed back to us...\nWe were disgusted! We went back to our room and enjoyed a fantastic breakfast the next day with no problems with the young waitress. We were thinking of complaining at the hotel but to be honest we had the impression that we weren't going to be taken seriously. I'm rating our stay as 3 stars \uFFFD as the hotel was lovely however the room could do with reflecting the quirky decor personality rather than just the main house, the food was stunning but the customer service needs a major change.

They were several things that could have been addressed..namely the curtains were missing several hooks so hung badly.  The shower, albeit very clean had mould in the corners & a stain from a leak in the ceiling.  There was a large mirror but it was not over the dressing table\u002Fdesk & the TV was sited in front of the mirror.

We were the only people in the dining room for most of our dinner, being joined by one other couple later, which did not provide much of an ambience.   \n\nWe ordered the beetroot & goats cheese salad....the beetroot was hard, cold & tasteless & there was only 2 very thin slices of goats cheese on the bottom & top layer, which certainly was insufficient.  The caramelised walnuts accompanying it were nice.\n\nThe main course I had was ok....fillet of brill with roasted red peppers & baby saffron potatoes with a bouillabaisse sauce.   The fish was overcooked with very little taste & the sauce was the same, very little seasoning.  My hubby had the cassoulet which again was very average.   The waiters were very attentive but when we asked for some bread to go with our starter we were told that no sides were available.

However for \u00A395 a night you would have at least expected a TV & Kettle in our room.  When I went downstairs to ask if there should be tea and coffee making facilities in our room, I was told it is not provided in the main house bedrooms and was offered to have some sent up.  However this left me feeling a little uncomfortable as I was not told if this would be paid for extra or included? Not to be tight but you would expect Tea & coffee to be provided as you would in any premier inn.  Another let down was the lack of TV, although it was nice having a night away from it we luckily had a lovely free standing bath which we spent most of the night in and took a walk around the grounds. Again just something you would expect in 2017 and were unaware of this when we booked the room.  \n\nDinner in the restaurant was probably the highlight, the food was fantastic - however again something we were mislead about on the website was the menu.  We had previously taken a look and with my partners food requirements the menu seemed fine but upon receiving our evening menus it was completely different to the one online and only had one meal my partner could eat but luckily it was delicious.  We also had dessert which was great.  The staff were pleasant.  \n\nBreakfast was beautiful, very fresh and grilled the way we like it - again however there was a note on the bottom of the menu stating a second breakfast would incur a charge of \u00A399 which is absolutely ridiculous and a 45minute wait.  There is no need for that snotty comment at all.  \n\nThe decor is very unusual and probably not to everyone's taste - lots of latex half nude women all over the walls but we found it quite amusing.  \n\nAll in all we had a good stay due to our own company!

Unfortunately, that was the best part of the trip. \n\nWe checked in only to be told that we were staying in the annex a short walk away down the gravel drive (our suitcases were already at reception) and there was no one to help with our luggage. Having done a lot of research around the hotel we had assumed we were staying in the main house which had recently undergone a renovation \u2013 however were bitterly disappointed with our room.\n\nRoom: \nWhen we entered the room we were shocked to see such a dull space. The furniture had stains on, it was freezing cold and had no natural light. It wasn\u2019t the cool, quirky rooms shown on the website. To be honest, we felt like we had stepped in a time machine and been escorted back to 1999. There was no iron, ironing board, hairdryer and the towels smelt musty as if had been sat there for a few days.  \n\nHotel:\nAfter checking in to our room and lugging our bags along the gravel driveway, we were in desperate need of a large drink. We had sat in one of the many \u2018lounge\u2019 rooms which were fully equipped with large open fires (none of them worked, hence it was cold) and waited\u2026and waited...and waited. Finally my husband went in search of a bar or member of staff and stumbled across Marco Pierre White\u2019s restaurant, Wheeler\u2019s, where we had booked dinner for that evening. He ordered drinks (the options of drinks were slim, with no fresh lime for our vodka\u002Flime\u002Fsoda and luke warm white wine). I had to ask three times for a glass of ice to cool down my wine. We had asked if there were any nuts or olives available, at which point the waitress offered pipped olives at 4.50GBP for a small bowl \u2013 we ordered \u2013 they came \u2013 with pips. The rooms had no background music or buzz and with the restaurant being so far away, each time we wanted to order a drink we had to go in search of a member of staff.\n\nRestaurant:\nWe headed into the restaurant for dinner earlier than expected, mainly because after a walk around the grounds there is not much more to do. The Instagram page had shown a pool table and board games, however the front of house staff couldn\u2019t help. We sat in the restaurant for dinner which was extremely dark and had to ask to switch the lights on to see what we were eating. \n\nDinner \u2013 Admittedly, the food was incredible, however it was such a shame that the restaurant was so empty hence lacked atmosphere. It was a Friday night during a bank holiday weekend so we expected it to be buzzing. Marco Pierre White\u2019s son was also staying at the hotel \u2013 and proceeded to interfere the poor waiters\u002Fwaitresses service a considerable number of times which was hugely off putting. We had to ask for bread when we sat down and while the staff were attentive, we didn\u2019t feel like we were in a super luxurious restaurant as we\u2019d hoped. \n\nBreakfast \u2013 This was a complete farce. The only coffee available was via an old school cafetiere \u2013 no cappucino\u2019s\u002Fespresso\u2019s or lattes available. My sister had asked for her eggs to not include the yolk \u2013 a small request at a 5* restaurant. The waiter immediately said no, he wouldn\u2019t even ask the chef. He advised that the eggs came one way (poached) and would not be changed. There was also a really strange note on the menu advising guests that if an extra breakfast is wanted then the price would be 99GBP and to expect a 45 minute wait. 99GBP!!!!!!!!!!!!!! For a breakfast which consisted of one egg, 2 rashers of bacon, one sausage and half a tomato. 45 minutes?! I have never seen anything quite so bizarre. \n\nGrounds: Credit where it\u2019s due, the hotel is set upon beautiful grounds with lots of farm animals and wildlife. The village of Corsham is lovely and great for a relaxing weekend (perhaps a different hotel though!) \n\nCheck-out: Upon check out we were greeted with the fact that the hotel doesn\u2019t have change. Hence our bill of 193GBP couldn\u2019t return the 7GBP change as they simply didn\u2019t have it. I live abroad and my card had been blocked, hence I only had cash. \n\nOverall if you are thinking of booking this hotel, my advice would be to look elsewhere.

I loved the fact books were left for people to read. I loved wandering around the overgrown gardens avoiding the geese, chatting to the gleenies and the grumpy turkeys. It reminded me of my childhood in the wilds of Devon. The restaurant with its contemporary art and the feel of a greenhouse with all the plants (well it had been the greenhouse originally) had a different feel. The food was good and the chocolate mousse was out of this world. Not a buffet breakfast as the hotel has a smallish kitchen so limited space.

By 7.30 some of the starter and main course options were no longer available, we were told, because everything is sourced daily and the fish and shellfish were brought up from Cornwall.  Strange though to run out of Shepard's pie which I believe was popular due to residents using a voucher. My companion ordered the lobster ,  we were aware when ordering it was the last lobster , after sometime we were informed that this lobster had proved to be not fit to serve when opened by chef. Not restaurants fault of course, if that was the case. Then some time later we were told our mains took longer because we had not ordered starters, so presumably, order got forgotten.   The main course of fish must have been served at least an hour after being seated but it was delicious. The restaurant is very pleasant environment , candlelit and very pretty.  Asked for refill of water which never arrived. Female wait staff only provided any service when presenting bill.\nService and food at breakfast was excellent. \nWould like to return visit and stay in main rooms but would check menu prior to booking table and would eat early. Agree with other comments that drink menus would be helpful. ",3,negative

Offered us dinner and breakfast with them but offered us accommodation in a local '4 star' B and B which turned out to be a nearby grubby little pub (kind of booking the Ritz and staying at a hostel!!). We returned to the hotel and politely declined their offer, the manager suggested we had dinner and return for bed and breakfast another WE. We insisted that we'd have dinner- a small compensation for the inconvenience and upset-that night but a new booking should include dinner. The manager reluctantly agreed and a new date was set although this was after a lot of dispute and debate all embarrassing played out in the main restaurant whilst we were eating. A couple of weeks later received email saying they couldn't honour the booking and we'd get our money back. I've waited til now to post this, once we'd actually got the refund.

Room 6 is simply gorgeous! the artwork is delightful. Prints of Isabella Rossalini, Boy George, The Rolling Stones, Peter Sellers and Marco himself. Lovely bed linen and incredibly comfortable bed. The luxurious bathroom was stunning. It had a rolltop bath and slippers and bathrobes were provided. There is no hospitality tray but that is perfectly understandable given the antique furniture and the receptionist told us should we want any teas or coffes just to ring down and they would be brought up.\n\nThe service and attention were second to none (even providing wellies and barbour jackets in order to explore the extensive grounds in comfort). There is a lovely wee gypsy caravan in amongst some trees opposite the main door in order to have a smoke without getting soaked!

There were tables and chairs dotted around under shelter of the trees at the back of the house.\n\nWe had dinner in the restaurant in the evening which was sublime and incredibky reasonable. My main of fillet steak and snails on a bed of peas and baby pearl onions and potato boulangeres was only \u00A322,50. I recently paid the same for fillet steak and chips (nothing else) in Glasgow.

We were completely blown away with the antiques in the main house and the unique design of each room. The residence was only a few minutes away from Bath and the local country villages and towns.  The tiny little bar and the rooms you could go to for a quiet night cap were beautiful and relaxing.\n\nThe staff were incredible and we send a special \""Thank you \"" to Grant, Christoph,Nigel, Chris, Titch and of course \""Clive\""  for making us feel part of the family. Others we haven't named were also lovely.\n\nThere is no TV in the rooms and also no direct phone link with reception which we actually loved.\n\nThere were sets of wellies and coats so you put them on and investigate the small farm they use for their cooking.  We are very keen on excellent produce and it was great to see it being grown and farmed.\n\nIt became apparent while we were there that this place is actually Marco Pierre White's \""baby\"". Every detail is personally approved and sourced and with this pride also comes some of the challenges.\n\nThe Menu was specific and amended daily based on what is fresh and will maintain the highest quality that can be prepared given the facilities available. We understood this as foodies and respect the professional aim and end product. On the flip side, however, it did mean that the menu was limited and inflexible and you had to choose what was there and prepared exactly as specified.  e.g. If it said, \""poached eggs\"" this meant you could not swap it for fried or scrambled. We actually ventured outside to another's restaurant one evening because the menu hadn't changed and I ( not my wife) would have had to have eaten the same dish again. This is unfortunate because we went there initially because of the restaurant.\n\nWhile the venue was excellent. What could have made the experience out of this world.  I need to be fair here because we are reviewing the venue and not the professional  \""Marco\"" as an owner personally.   \n\nMarco was around the venue at the same time as we were. We were not paying for his pesonal services or attention and so it is not really fair to include him in this review.   \n\nThis said I have been around enough Famous people to know how it can exponentially enhance a clients experience when professionals of his caliber and public standing can take a few moments to make peoples day with a few nice words or a hand shake.  \n \nTo be fair there can be little worse for public figures than being continually hounded by the public and so my wife and I are never comfortable breaking into their personal time or space and so we just smiled and nodded when we saw Marco and said good morning etc.  \n\nIt would have been lovely if he could have made a small effort personally to welcome people to his \""baby\"" especially as we saw him every day for 4 days.

The check in was efficient, if not very warm. And the two people in reception were bickering between themselves. However, after this, I can say without qualification, that all the other staff we cam across were charming and helpful. \n\nWe had a \""Superior\"" room, which was a little extra. However, I'm guessing the only thing superior was the size of the room, which was in fact a one bedroom apartment. The decor was tired, the bed was a 4ft 6in in the space for a 5ft. The furniture was old and the sofa clearly bore the greasy marks of several guests heads on the top of the back support. The pillows were woeful. \n\nWe had one evening meal there, which was pleasant, the food was good if somewhat heavy. The wine list was adequate but not very interesting. However, the lighting is so dim in the restaurant that we required torches to read the menu, and this coupled with the extraordinarily large size of the pieces in Mr White's art collection gave an overall impression of claustrophobia, rather than a pleasant intimacy.I enjoyed the artwork in general, but it isn't for the faint hearted, or the easily offended, and Mr White quite clearly loves himself deeply, as evidenced by the large photographic prints of him from his \""White Heat\"" days.  Breakfasts were a mixed bag as well..... Each breakfast plate offered was OK, (although the black pudding on the English breakfast plate was quite unpleasant.....and we both love black pudding), however, at the level this hotels sells itself, I do think cheap sliced bread for the toast is unacceptable. Breakfast basically consists of not terribly good orange juice, cheap sliced bread for toast, butter and marmalade. Plus whatever breakfast \""plate\""  you choose.The selection is quite nice....however, and this is a huge negative for me, if you chose the full English, that was one plate, but if you wanted a plats of fruit as well, then you are advised that there will be a supplemental charge of \u00A399 and a 45 minute wait for this extra food. It leaves a very nasty taste in the mouth. Your final impression is that of a hotel which is too greedy and too full of it's own importance, without any substance to back it up.....",3,negative

No TV to distract (You can watch Eric Monkman on your ipad instead).  I was visiting friends and met for supper at just after 8pm. Had a glass of wine in the newest of four guest lounges, before heading to the restaurant. It's candle lit, very intimate and again reflects the owner's keen attention to detail.

Grouse for main, which I'd never had before (Why?I have absolutely no idea) - with a shared bottle of Burgundian Pinot Noir. Now desert - chocolate mousse as served in Maxim's - no more to say here, really. Sensationally smooth and rich, though not cloyingly so.

Our favourite thing was definitely Clive the dog!! Stayed in the treetop accomadation and again some reviews had been quite negative, no idea why because the room was perfect! The comfiest bed I have ever slept in, we certainly didn't want to leave in the morning. Again the artwork in the room and books were fab! The meal was spectacular, quail egg starter so good!! Breakfast was equally as good, the best I've ever had when staying at a hotel! Restaurant had a lovely atmosphere. The only minor disappointment was not getting to see the man himself although we will 100% be returning, got home this evening and already planning our next visit.

The first time we stayed in the David Bailey room with his fantastic photos and other quirky settings in the room like the windmill, wooden train and old phone. His photos have been moved down to one of the many lounges. The second time we stayed was when the refurbishment was taking place so we stayed in the Tree tops in one of the basement appartments, very nice. Both times the menu in the restaurant was great and food fab. This time we stayed in room 232 and  I'm affraid I had an issue with the bedding, I am allergic to bio washing powder and I think that the bedding had been washed in that as I was itching all night. This time the menu was quite limited, although what we chose was very good, Duck breast and Partridge, both perfectly cooked. I had Duck broth as my starter and when I asked for a bread roll I was told they didn't have any but I was offered sour dough bread which was very nice. I found that the wine was quite over priced, we were at Marco's steak house in Cardiff the weekend before and had a really good bottle of Pinot Noir for less than \u00A320. This was my birthday treat and unfortunately didn't live upto my expectations, I'm dissapointed you have not replaced the retro games room which was so much fun but merely indulged in many dark lounges. We have bought our daughter and husband a two night stay with dinner on both nights for her birthday, I hope they get a different choice of menu each night as one couple we were talking to sait they had the same menu.

Sadly these expectations were unfulfilled and left us both wondering what all the hype is about. \nFirstly I want to say that we have been to Marco Piere Whites restaurants before and always had pleasant experiences hence why the hotel experience was so appealing. The hotel itself is situated in a lovely setting with some lovely views; so if thats your thing then you will be in your element. Inside the hotel is awash with portraits of Marco himself and of other biblical \u002F sexual photos, which isn\u2019t an issue it\u2019s just something that isn\u2019t the norm across hotels. Upon arrival we were taken to our room which was room 3 in the main building. The room was nice although cold however that didn\u2019t take away from the  decor and wonderful bathroom. \nMe and my wife then went and sat in one of the lounges which are decorated in there own unique way. The ambiance I felt the hotel were trying to portray was a home from home feeling as the rooms were full of large comfy sofas however no electrical entertainment but there was WiFi. Upon ordering our drinks the waitress told us that the service that evening was very busy and to get to the restaurant early. In light of this we planned to get to the restaurant for 7pm. First issue was the water in our room we had none! I went to investigate to be told it\u2019s a old house and it happens from time to time give it a few minutes and it should be ok. We also had no coffee or tea making facilities. I am all for the minimalistic approach however with no room service available I have to go downstairs and order it and then take it back to the room which seems odd. I later found out some rooms had a tv in them, coffee making facilities and complimentary chocolates all of which we had none. Anyway not major issues just some observations. On to dinner the main part of the stay; we arrived with great expectations as this after all is Marcos main residents and as such you\u2019d expect high standards. Unfortunately our experience wasn\u2019t of a high standard. First off the restaurant was around a quarter full so I expected it to really fill up throughout our meal however this was not the case. I won\u2019t bore you with the meal as I am no food critic, suffice to say I sent my main shepherds pie back as it arrived cold. It was nice but my mom could probably cook up something similar, presentation awful too, just slopped on the plate; waited 1 hour for desert to be told they had run out of the desert I ordered. Just seemed a bit of a shambles if I am honest and ruined for me the experience as this restaurant comes no where near the experiences we have had at other Marco establishments. There were other couples too being told mains were out of stock along with deserts it was just amateurish not something you would expect of a guy that prides himself on standards. In all we were at dinner for 2 and a half hours the couple next to us even longer. \nBreakfast was nice couldn\u2019t complain although the \u00A399 charge for a second course at breakfast appears very steep and out of order.\nIn all I wouldn\u2019t return or give anyone a recommendation to go as the hype failed to deliver big time, it\u2019s a shame as the hotel i am sure has the potential to be wonderful. This may have just been a bad experience or maybe it\u2019s just not my cup of tea and I don\u2019t get what the hotel is looking to achieve but I will stay clear. ",2,negative

Not a great start.\n\nSecondly, On entry to my apartment I was flabbergasted to be met with an open, unused dirty toilet to my left hand side. Again, very surprised to have such a poor first impression in a 4* facility. Unsure if this area is part of our suite but I suspect that it was supposed to be cleaned and locked?

Unfortunately I was unexpectedly admitted to Hospital so we were forced to cancel just 2 or 3 days before. So when a Groupon deal became available we jumped at the chance to try it. And we are so delighted that we did. The whole place is just so fairy tale from beginning to end. First and foremost the hotel itself has been so beautifully restored and furnished with tremendous artistic flair that is apparently Marco himself. Antiques and memorabilia absolutely fill every corner of this vast 'house in the woods' inside and out. The lovely 14 acres of grounds are beautifully maintained and are home to lots of rare breed pigs and dozens of rare breed chickens that apparently provide the eggs for breakfast. The food as one would expect is superb and beautifully presented. Quite a limited but interesting dinner menu with every item having a gourmet twist. Breakfast was as absolute delight where one is looked after by Nigel for which nothing is too much trouble. He's been there for 14 years himself long before Marco but it it obvious when you talk to both him any of the young staff that they are all tremendously fond of Marco and feel privileged to be working there. One interesting feature is 'Clive' the Greyhound who is apparently Marco's loyal companion when he is in residence. He quietly wanders around the house looking for a warm radiator to lay by. The most plasid well behaved and clean canine you gave ever seen. We absolutely love the place and have in fact booked for Christmas 2018. On the deal we booked our accomodation was in the 'annexe'. I wrongly assumed the room would be more basic than those in the main hotel but in fact they are wonderfully refurbished apartments with excellent facilities and every comfort one could wish for. Like everywhere else in the hotel it was warm and welcoming. If you're the least bit interested in 'Quirky' you gust have to try The Rudloe Arms. But don't forget your camera.",5,positive

Beautiful interior with mood lighting , beautiful artwork and sculptures.\nWe were upgraded due to our problematic booking experience and our rooms were stunning , very clean and furnished to the highest standard , 3 stars is way too low for the hotel .\nThat aside the restaurant was absolutely appalling, the worst I have ever experienced.\nWe were presented with the menu in the afternoon, the website advertises steaks , lobster etc the reality is , cheap low budget poor quality food .\nWe had a table booked at 8pm , we were finally seated at 8.45pn . The poor staff were run off there feet dealing with disappointed customers . One of the waitresses was full of attitude and would certainly benefit from some training . Celia was excellent and seems to run the place .\n\nWhen finally seated My choice was boiled egg with salad cream and a few minute frozen shrimps , chicken pie  and peas , the pie was inedible , frozen greasy flaky pastry and over cooked frozen peas , I declined desert .My teenage son could cook better !\nOur neighbouring table requested to return the pie as it was disgusting  and have fish and chips , they were told yes of course if you wish to pay an extra \u00A325 !! \n\nOn a more positive note breakfast was very nice . \n\nWe actually thought it must be a franchise and Marco just had his name to it , but he was actually in situ yesterday ...... come on Marco you have the makings of an amazing  place , get some good suppliers and decent chefs and they will be queuing at the door as you have a very special place . \n",1,negative

Definitely punches above its weight as a 3 star.\nNow, the shocking surprise was we stay away 2 weekends a month, so very seasoned travellers, but first time we stayed at a hotel with a Michelin star chef name above the door.\nThe advertised sample menu shows lobster, steaks, lamb, foie grass, the actual menu was pea soup, boiled eggs, fish and chips, ham and eggs, a million miles away from fine dining.  Totally disappointing, felt robbed and cheated. I would never had stayed here had I seen this poor cheap menu before arriving. Given it is a Michelin starred chef it was shocking that is was by far the worst food we've had anywhere in 5yrs.\nIts such a shame because the hotel is fabulous.\nBreakfast was even worse. The cheapest supermarket sliced bread for toast, cheapest carton orange juice, cheap smoked bacon and when asked if I could have a fried egg, was told no it's poached egg or nothing.  Even a roadside cafe offers a simple choice of eggs. The breakfast staff were lovely though.\nWill I go back? I.ll stay in the hotel but never eat there again.",1,negative

We were put in Room 10 which is a three room suite (Bedroom, Sitting Room and Bathroom with roll top bath) at the top of the building. There is Wi-Fi throughout and we hardly noticed the absence of a television. The bedroom suite was warm (It was snowing outside), spacious, clean and the bed was very comfortable. Rather than carpet, the floors are covered in a plastic fitted floor covering, except for the bathroom floor which is tiled. The staff that serve Breakfast and Dinner were dressed in period clothes each one was friendly, efficient and polite. During dinner the manager Kieran was in the restaurant making sure everything was okay. The food throughout our stay was delicious and well presented, which is what you should expect. \nThe main house is as interesting as is the Objet d'art which fills each room and spills out in to the hall stairs and corridors. Even the bedroom has antique furniture with a scattering of sculptures, while the walls are covered in pictures\u002Fphotographs; to add further interest there are a selection of books. \nOn the ground floor there are four reception rooms each with a different theme. The Reception rooms are primarily arranged for people to socialise, or spend quiet time reading, or admiring Marco\nPierre White\u2019s personal collection of antiques, curios, toys and modern art.\nNeedless to say we had a wonderful stay.\nThe Spa town of Bath is 9 miles away and the Market Town of Chippenham is 7 miles away. There is a bus stop close to the entrance of the hotel grounds.\nPrior to staying at the Rudloe Arms we were a little confused by the mixed reviews; having now stayed here perhaps I can suggest an explanation. If you are looking for a plain vanilla four star hotel with leisure facilities, then the Rudloe Arms is not the place for you. If you are looking for a quaint, charming and quirky country retreat which feels more like a home than a hotel and where every room is different, then you are going to love your stay here.\nThe hotel is aimed solely at adults. Some people may consider some of the art as risqu\u00E9; but to be fair, it reflects Marco Pierre White\u2019s taste and of course you should expect several black & white poster photographs of Marco in his younger days. Clearly Marco doesn\u2019t cook the meals, but a number of recipes are attributed to Marco and the chef in the kitchen clearly very talented.   ",5,positive

Although we had booked for 22nd April (my husband's birthday) we were unable to go that weekend due to illness.  I did finally manage to contact the hotel on the Saturday and a pleasant young lady happily re-booked us for the following weekend, though our voucher stated plainly \""no changes\"".  On arrival we were very pleasantly surprised at the warm greeting we met with.\n\nWe stayed in the \""Treetops\"" building down the drive.  The room was spacious, but quite dark, however the bed was supremely comfortable, with great squishy pillows and superb quality bed linen.  We were provided with coffee pods to go in the coffee machine, fresh milk and kit kat bars.  These were not topped up the following day but happily provided on request.  Towels were very good quality and size.  Minor niggles... the grouting in the shower needed replacing and some curtain hooks were missing + only 3 hangers provided though there were rings for more.  A little bit of TLC would easily overcome these shortcomings.\n\nThe lounges and restaurant in the main house are truly amazing.  There is enough of interest in all of them to engage your interest for many evenings.  Surprisingly, despite the clutter they are also amazingly clean and dust free.  We did not feel comfortable in the room with all the dead deer and fish... and we noticed that no other guests ever sat in that room much to our amusement, but it was worth a look and was certainly a talking point.\n\nWe were clearly on the \""set menu\"" which was indeed basic, but the ingredients, though \""cheap and cheerful\"" were good quality for what they were, well cooked and presented.  One evening my husband had the Aberdeen Angus fillet steak at a \u00A37.50 supplement.  He said it was the best fillet steak he'd had for a long while.  It would have been nice to have been offered the a la carte menu in case we'd wanted to splash out, but having been in the catering business ourselves we could understand them not wanting to have expensive ingredients in stock when the hotel was not at full capacity and many guests were on \""deals\"".  It isn't a Michelin starred restaurant and does not pretend to be.  Drinks are expensive, but are top end brands (e.g. Sipsmith gin) and not more expensive than many establishments local to us with less to offer.\n\nThe staff were absolutely lovely and I would particularly like to mention Celia and Oriana who were especially welcoming and went out of their way to make our stay memorable.  We did not meet Marco, though apparently some other guests did and said how charming he was to them.

If you do have the time, read on so you can make an informed decision before booking. I would hate misguided expectations to let you down.\n\nMr. White\u2019s  \u2018house in the woods\u2019 is like nowhere you will have stayed before \u2013 I have had the good fortune to stay in some wonderful hotels across the globe and to dine in some of the finest restaurants \u2013 nowhere is like Rudloe! It is unique.\n\nIf you want a buffet \u2018all the cornflakes you can eat\u2019 breakfast and a travel kettle with UHT milk and digestive biscuits in your room, go to a Travelodge.\n\nIf you want high speed WIFI, BBC world service on loop and multiple clocks telling you the time in London, Tokyo and New York, go to a Hilton.\n\nIf you want prim and proper and quintessentially British, try Chewton Glen or Cliveden.\n\nIf you want Michelin star food and 3 staff per head pandering to your every whim\u2026and the \u00A3300 per head bill for dinner to accompany it, try any number of places in and around London.\n\nBut if you want something different, something that lets you escape reality for a while, something that challenges the imagination, a place where you will feel unrivalled peace and tranquility, part of a family, where the owner invites you into his home and through this deeply personal \u2018project\u2019 presents an insight into his unique life and world, than this is for you.\n\nCLEANLINESS: You could eat your dinner of the floor! - rare for a county house hotel \u2013 even the good ones usually smell like old ladies cardigans! or require you to share your room with resident spiders and or the odd mouse! But not here \u2013 Immaculate throughout.\n\nFOOD: Not pretentious or trying to hard \u2013 Its not Michelin star food and I hope it never is! It is food that leaves you satiated and warm inside, not food that means you need to buy a mars bar on the way home or that requires you to have attended a Swiss finishing school just to decipher which fork you should use \u2018to be socially acceptable\u2019. The menu is concise and well balanced. Lets the ingredients shine \u2013 The steak is exceptional.\n\nSTAFF: Care passionately; go above and beyond, nothing is too much trouble. Living and breathing a shared vision not just turning up to collect a pay cheque.\n\nINTERIOR DESIGN AND ART: Eclectic and unique! Deeply personal and a window to view the soul of a beautiful mind. Provocative, thought provoking, stimulates discussion, exciting, sexy! Not a cheap Monet replica print in a laminate oak frame in sight!\n\nSTAR RATING: If you judge hotels based on * rating, this is probably not the place for you \u2013 It will never conform to the boring and outdated requirements of bodies like the AA to \u2018achieve\u2019 stars \u2013 it is so special because it doesn\u2019t conform!\n\nTECHNOLOGY: My WIFI and mobile signal were both fine \u2013 Albeit being in such a tranquil and peaceful setting made me turn it all off through choice! Bedrooms don\u2019t have TV\u2019s and if they ever do I will never go back! Eastenders would in my opinion ruin everything about the beautiful world you enter when you drive through the understated gates.\n\nLOCATION: Easy to find with a sat nav. Good access to surrounding beauty spots and tourist favorites such as Bath, Box valley, Cotswolds, Swindon etc\n\nPARKING: Directly outside and plenty for everyone \u2013 Please don\u2019t look for valet parking and a doorman.\n\nVALUE FOR MONEY: It is a priceless place because there is nothing like to compare it to! In my opinion it is priced appropriately and fairly for the unique experience and quality you will enjoy.\n\nOTHER: Romantic landscaping, secret private gardens and roaming animals add character to the overall setting. Multiple inviting lounges with open fires and sofas to cuddle on for when the British weather fails you.\n\nI agree it may not be for everyone but I will say one thing \u2013 it takes nothing to be polite and friendly. Even if this is not to your taste or not what you were expecting, be kind \u2013 don\u2019t act like money or status or position give you an automatic right of entitlement or licence to be rude. If it is not for you that is fine, nobody is forcing you to like it \u2013 there are plenty of Hiltons for you to choose from next time.\n\nFor those willing to open their mind and walk through the looking glass into wonderland, I am sure you will love every moment of your stay and return time and time again.",5,positive

Also, the staff are hard working and are doing their best to serve you, but there is not enough of them! The food, which we expected to be 1st class, was in fact a throw back to the 80's or 90's and was just not as good as we are used to in our local pub! The signage is very unclear to get to the place and inside, there is no indication of where reception is! Also, no fire regulations anywhere, which I though should be there by law ? The garden outside bears no resemblance to the online pictures, and is overgrown, and the path is completely blocked in places. Our room had ivy on the outside windows, and blinds that did not pull up, or windows that did not open. The water seemed to come and go sporadically, and if you flushed the toilet, you had to wait 3 or 4 minutes to wash your hands. The main evening meal on both nights were exactly the same, with a choice of 3 or 4 items per course.

The drinks were very expensive, with wine at \u00A330 a bottle, and a glass of wine and a bottle of beer \u00A313. The breakfast was disappointing. For some reason, they could not alter anything from the menu, for example, the cooked breakfast had poached egg, and you could not swap this for scrambled, even though another option was SCRAMBLED EGG! Also, I had the cooked breakfast on both mornings, and they were completely different (see pictures - see if you can spot the difference). The other thing, was at the bottom of the breakfast menu it stated that if you wanted any more breakfast, there would be a charge of \u00A399 and a wait of 45 mins ????? Overall, it was an experience that we won't forget, and to our surprise the main letdown was the food. This was surprising, as we saw MPW in the hotel, so he must be aware of this situation ?

Yes last time the food wasn\u2019t to our liking but this time what a difference. First of all we booked into the treetops. This is an annex building and we stayed in it before  so we knew what we were getting. Upon arrival we were told the hotel was fully booked and given an upgrade. The receptionist showed us our room and it was lovely. Nice decorations a nice big bed and really nice. She then said follow me upstairs. We though ok a room with 2 floors. On the second floor in our room was another bed a single. Just because there is room for it. Then she said and again if you go upstairs to the other room. What a room with 3 floors just wow. On the upper part was a seating area looking out high over the valley. Was amazing. If you stay in the main house be sure to ask for room 12. Only downside was the chickens live out the front and can be a little noisy in the morning but well worth it. People who stay in the main house also have a bottle of gin in the room for free but only if you buy the tonic from the bar. Later we found out that the tonic is \u00A33.50 per small bottle but it\u2019s 1 bottle 1 shot they measure after you leave and charge an additional \u00A39 per shot for anything over your allowance. Although this sounds like a con it\u2019s not really when you consider what you would pay in most pubs for a posh gin and tonic. So don\u2019t be going mad on the doubles. Dinner that night was brilliant. And could not fault it one bit. \nMarco was not at the hotel when we visited but we did meet Marco jnr. We chatted for ages with him and what a really nice down to earth guy totally not what I was expecting.

The staff in the hotel were lovely and very helpful.\nWe were accommodated in an apartment room outside the main building.  It was clean with a good bathroom but the beds were not very comfortable except for the pillows that were great.  We saw a room in the main building which was extraordinary in terms of decor.  \nThe food was terrible.  The evening meal which was included in our voucher deal was so very poor.  The menu was very limited - only 4 choices in each section.  One main course was ham and eggs but \u00A33.50 extra for chips which in the end could not be provided.  We had to ask for bread which was a piece of stale sourdough toasted on one side.  We then had to ask again for butter.  It was certainly very far from fine dining.\nBreakfast was equally poor.  I asked for granola and scrambled eggs but was told I could not have both.  The toast was cheap white bread.\nWe were due to stay two nights but we couldn't face more time in that dining room and we left.\nThe staff were apologetic and said how sorry they were.",1,negative

I lived in corsham many years ago and honestly never knew how amazing Rudloe Arms really was until we arrived there on the 31st July. It\u2019s a quirky, very very beautiful building and the interior was exactly my kind of taste. The room we were given was lovely and well kept, we had a full sized bath with separate corner shower which was great! The only thing that was would have made it better was a small fridge or mini bar. I must say that the bed was amazing! It was the most comfortable bed I\u2019ve slept in in a long time and I didn\u2019t want to get out of it lol. The grounds and gardens are beautiful although a little overgrown in parts I love it as it was like a little adventure exploring around them. We had breakfast which was complimentary and it was the most tastiest food I have ever had. Marco Pierre White popped in and said hello which was nice although my husband embarrassingly asked for a photo op with him!

And to do it most successfully too.\n\nThe owner has quite simply applied his true personality and character to this beautiful house and grounds to create a hotel like I have never before experienced.

This is not your typical, generic hotel experience - think of it more as Marco inviting you into his home, where each bedroom has been tastefully decorated and exudes his personality. Marco has not only chosen each item of furniture and artwork himself but he has put his heart into placing each piece with great detail so that no two bedrooms are the same. A beautiful balance has been struck between modern and contemporary and rustic and homely - the iconic photographs of Marco compliment the high ceilings and original stone staircases of Rudloe perfectly. You won\u2019t find any electronic key cards at Rudloe, instead you\u2019ll have your own bedroom door key, each tagged and numbered in Marco\u2019s handwriting - a truly personal experience. Marco has even devoted space in the lounge areas to photographs of his family, further adding to the homely feel.\n\nMoving outside, Rudloe is a proud, country house nestled within acres of landscape and which are home to all of Marco\u2019s animals, including cockerels and pigs, and not to mention the fruit trees which produce the perfect ingredients for the food which Rudloe has to offer.\n\nThe food at Rudloe is delicious. The Head Chef, Nathan, takes his inspiration from Marco and produces flavoursome, wholesome dishes, which will not leave you feeling hungry! The menu caters for everyone and is seasonal so guests can enjoy the produce when it is at its best. The Farmhouse Salad with homemade salad cream is a must! The breakfast menu is equally as generous and you mustn\u2019t leave Rudloe without trying the homemade baked beans. Delicious!\n\nThe staff at Rudloe are attentive and welcoming.

The hotel is a 3 star hotel and our room reflected that, shame at \u00A3150 a night, the price doesn't. Our room was very big, with a sitting room and kitchen, which is a bonus, but what is the point of a kitchen with no utensils? Nothing ! No pots pans, glasses of even cutlery? The room is grubby, with stains on the carpet, broken tiles, and marks on the walls. After reading previous reviews  about the bath, I was looking forward to seeing the bathroom...what a let down! The worst bathroom I've had in a hotel. No towel rail, toilet roll holder shelf or hook. Now to the breakfast....whilst the food is very tasty, I would pick a travel lodge or premier over the Rudloe breakfast every time. No fruit cereal or pastries? I asked for some granola, but because I had already picked a meal of scrambled eggs and smoked salmon, I can only pick 1 item from the menu??

Top quality ingredients, fragrant with a delicate combination of herbs, shards of \""real\"" ham. Big portion!\n\nBeetroot and goats cheese salad. No vac-pac vinegar soused beetroot here, cooked just past al dente.  Good cheese, perfectly ripe, not too strong. \n\nGame pie, meaty yet delicate somehow. Great pastry. A real madiera (I guess) and demi-glace based jus. I had the same or similar jus with my partridge (which makes sense) and it was perfect on both plates. \n\nPartridge - just past pink. In other words perfect. I had a side of spinach, just wilted, not bleeding water - again, in other words, perfect.\n\nKedgeree - for me kedgeree is a breakfast dish, but my wife disagrees. So does MPW. Hey, they're only human! (jk)\n\nBut what of all this \""demi-glace\""? \""Jus\""? what have we here, oh, right, one of those foodie nobs?  Wait a second before you judge - there's a reason I mentioned it: Really what I'm driving at is that although MPW no-longer aspires (guessing again) to the Michelin rat-race, there are certain fundamentals of \""serious\"" cooking that clearly he refuses to give up. You can make a decent sauce without demi-glace, possibly even with Knorr stockpots (wink wink), but you'll never get the depth of flavour achieved by the hours and hours of browning and simmering bones and reducing reducing reducing. This is what makes justifiably expensive restaurants expensive.  Good ingredients. And hours upon hours of labour. And then he's giving it away at Wowcher prices from time to time!  He must be doing it for love!\n\nThe man himself. To be honest I had always thought  - from the way his public image is reported - that he would probably be extremely arrogant, stand-offish, no time for his clientele. We bumped into him several times through the evening (while he continued to work after a long slog back from the other side of the country, where he had been working all day) and again this morning. \n\nTurns out he is utterly charming, a real gentleman, happy to pose for a photo, to talk about where he sources certain ingredients. He even offered me some produce as a gift, which I declined, as I did not have a gift for him in return. By the way, this is the husband talking, not the star-struck wife ;)\n\nFinally, the decor\u002Fartwork, MPW has seen the world and rubbed shoulders with a lot of interesting people, including artists, musicians and photographers. He has a lot of interesting art and photography on display, some of which might - to some - be mildly provocative. There's nothing remotely pornographic about any of the decor, nothing gratuitous. Michaelangelo's David has his bits out - that's not porno, that's art! And there are no bits on display at The Rudloe Arms.\n\nI really don't understand the bad reviews of this place. I can't for the life of me imagine what it would have to take to please those reviewers!\n\nThanks for an excellent B&B and dinner experience, Mr White. My wife and I have made a pact to come back whenever we can, our go-to night away when the grandparents can take the kids. Look forward to our next stay already.\n\nOh! One negative... drinks are pricey, but I don't begrudge it, considering the overall value is amazing.",5,positive

The welcome is charming and we got a little tour of the main house and ethos behind guests stay with them. The house and art is incredible. Generally the house was dimly lit as was the restaurant in the evening (I would prefer some contrast to this). The uniform that the female staff were required to wear was ineffective, gingham supposed to look in keeping with the house, I think they would look better in something plain and black in the 21st century! The room we stayed in was very spacious with a separate lounge, filled with caricature art. The sofa was not good to sit on, the bed was comfortable however. The bathroom lets it down, needs a refurb (leaking tap, the air flow in a windowless room doesn\u2019t work etc). Some lighting on the walk to the hotel and restaurant would be nice, failing that, take a torch also umbrellas would be a treat on short walk in rain to hotel from Treetops.The meal was very good, well presented and delicious.

It turns out, those negative reviews were justified.\n\nWe arrived at around half 5 which meant it was dark and the place is poorly signposted and had very little light outside the buildings- definitely could be worked on.\n\nOur greeting was lovely, the lady showed us around, explained that as we walk through the front door, their job is to serve us and also explained the ridiculous outfits that they were wearing-  are supposedly victorian dress in keeping with the feel of the house. Not only was it only the females that had to dress this way, it made no sense and a white blouse and black apron would be far more effective and in keeping with the males dress code.\n\nThe hotel is decorated well with quirky and different art all around, however it is extremely dimly lit throughout and this is annoying when you can't see what you are eating- the whole hotel is extremely warm also.\n\nMy main issues were the food and drinks, we were unable to use the bar because Marco was hosting a private event, which meant we loitered until we found someone to ask- then when the drinks came they were ridiculously over priced.. \u00A360 on 5 drinks!!\n\nWe sat for our meal at 7.30 and after amuse bouche we waited an hour before our starters came, and only after I complained. Our table was looked at numerous times and ignored- eventually our starters came and were disapointing. My partner had the pie and said it was tasty, whilst I had the truffled eggs...glorified egg mayo. \n Our main came quite quickly and it was an OK meal but the partridge legs were really tough and the dumplings very stodgy. Nearly all the mains had a surcharge on, and not a \u00A32 one, a \u00A312 one!!\n\nOur table was cleared and nobody offered us a dessert menu, so I had to ask for one.\nBy this time it was obvious that Marcos party was a priority over paying guests. His son Marco Jnr was extremely scruffy and was in and out of the restaurant and kitchen, distracting members of staff.\n\nFinally we had dessert of cheese and fruit cake which was actually lovely and served to us by Marcos daughter- Mirabelle, probably the only waiting staff with any manners and sense of urgency- a credit to the place.\n\nBreakfast was by far the best meal of the whole stay,  eggs royale beautifully cooked and a lovely basket of toast, it did make us laugh looking at the bottom of the menu and had you been particularly hungry and fancied another breakfast it was a \u00A399 surcharge and a 45 min wait!!\n\nThe bedroom in treetops was clean and spacious, the shower had no hot water and the bed not comfortable- all be it the duvet and pillows were.\n\nAll in all a mediocre stay with overpriced drinks and average food- I wouldn't rush back.

The Chateau Marmont in LA. The Rudloe Arms hotel won't be for everyone. The lighting is (I think) beautifully dim throughout. Almost to the point of candlelight. There are lots of giant nude photos here and there. So, if you are on the conservative side be warned.\n\nHaving said that, Marco Pierre White (celebrity chef personality) has curated a museum\u002Fart gallery full of eccentricity within the main building, which is WELL worth the price to upgrade to!\n\nAll the staff ... Hortense who helped us make the reservation and Fiona who checked us in were friendly and helpful. Nigel was awesome at breakfast. Our only regret was not running into the man himself, MPW to tell him how much we loved our stay.\n\nWe had a great room with lots of space to move around in. It had fun (expensive) antiques ... victorian dressing shelf, farmhouse tables and loads of potted plants and handpainted floor tiles. It was like something out of Archatectural Digest. Just perfect!\n\nWe had come in on a red eye from the US but tried to stay awake as long as we could to enjoy the wonderful room before heading into London for our anniversary. Our rate included a 5 course dinner (4 really ... they count coffee as a course) and a breakfast.\n\nThe dinner was okay. All the food was well prepared ... the only miss was that the filet with escargot had no escargot. It was mentioned the snails were blended into the cream used to top the steak. It took 2.5 hours, so realize you will be at the table for a bit. The English breakfast in the a.m. was amazing and our waiter Nigel was absolutely great.\n\nOverall, we both this hotel to have a perfect vibe and feel. The only thing I could point out as a fault would be the lack of shower in the main rooms. The giant soaking tub was relaxing for her at night but just did not cut it for me in the morning.

There was a massive television which was too big for the room and should have been mounted on the wall.\nThere was only 1 bedside table with a light that did not work, a unit with cups, saucers and a nespresso style coffee maker, no tea or kettle available. There was no information in the room with details on how to use the coffee makers, or that tea was not available, nothing on meal times, or contact numbers as you would normally find in a room.

Didn\u2019t expect the weekend from hell that we ended up with.\nWe were shown the room by a very pleasant receptionist. We found first of all that if you didn\u2019t like coffee you were out of luck as there was no other facilities (Tea bags, Kettle). To operate a completely strange coffee machine was not rocket science but an elder person could have had serious problems and consequences as there was no operating instructions. Had our coffee after mopping up the excess water that leaked out the machine and settled down to watch the \u201CPostage stamp sized TV\u201D before dinner which had a really bad signal on most channels. Gave the TV up and went for a shower. The shower door came off the runners before I could even get in so we reported it to reception where a lovely member of staff said she would mend the door as she\u2019s \u201CDone it before\u201D. It then came off the runners another 3 times. I then put a towel up to stop the water flooding out and put the shower on where the thermostat control came off in my hand. Gave up the shower. The hot water was lukewarm in the bath and non existent in the sink. The illuminated bathroom mirror did not work also. The central heating thermostat didn\u2019t work but fortunately the duvet cover provided extra warmth. The bedside light switch was dodgy and buzzing and the light kept going on and off.

On the Sunday we had a walk around the grounds outside which you really must take time to do .\nAll in all we had a wonderful weekend away , one that we will remember .

We were so excited with the idea of dining at the establishment of the world renowned chef Marco Pierre White. \n\nAs most of the reviews state, the staff were friendly, but that is where it all ends. Our room was quite nice, but what struck one was the forced pretentiousness of trying to bring in a dark element throughout the hotel. A feature in our room was a wall panel with 7 taxidermied crows, quite cute but why 7, which signifies a curse? Then on the landing in front of our bedroom door, a levitating shop mannequin with an ouija board t-shirt. It all had a rather dark feel to it.\n\nAn irritating aspect of the room was the lack of a dressing table or mirror near any plug. Also no TV or coffee making facilities in the room. Our bathroom was really lovely though, filled with plants and a big ball-and-claw bath.\n\nThe dinner started out with an average but tasty pea and ham soup. Not rocket science. For the main course I had the garlic and escargot steak. The steak was completely drenched in garlic. When enquiring about the lack of escargot, we were told that it was infused with escargot. My partner had pheasant with \""Madeira Jus\"" and dumplings. The pheasant was overcooked, tasteless and rubbery. The dumplings were raw dough balls. It was awful! We couldn't believe it. After two starters and the mains, we were hoping for a good dessert. No chance! Unpleasantly bitter chocolate mousse and hopelessly sweet over-sherried trifle in ugly little glasses. So badly presented! This was rounded off by coffee and inedible chocolates. The only tasty thing about the dinner were the chips, which we had to pay for extra. Our bottle of wine was \u00A340, one of the cheapest. We paid \u00A395 for 4 beers, a bottle of wine and 2 small portions of chips.\n\nThe sad fact is that the \""world renowned chef\"" was in the house, as I happened to stumble into one of the dining rooms where he was sitting reading, just before our dinner.\n\nBreakfast in the morning was watery and raw scrambled eggs with salmon for me and my partner had the eggs benedict, which was really nice.\n\nI am not the kind of person who usually likes to write reviews or bring anyone down, but  we were expecting so much more, and left thinking it was an absolute joke. We are not the kind of people who can usually afford something like this, so it was a very special occasion for us. We were so so disappointed. \n\nThe funny thing is that we live only 11 minutes away from the establishment and used this as our one-year anniversary treat. On the bright side, at least it will be one we won't forget.",1,negative

You will be more disappointed than you have ever been with the food. Food is ok at best but nowhere near what you would expect from a Michelin star (3 times!!!) chef. Don't book more than 1 meal because the menu doesn't change daily and the choice is very limited. If you don't like mushrooms then you'll go hungry. I ordered partridge. It was tough. I was told it was because it was \""out of season\""! Why the hell is it on the menu then! Only 6 main course choices and 3 of them are fillet steak for \u00A312.50 supplement! We ordered a bottle of red wine, one of the cheapest at \u00A345 (\u00A36.50 in Sainsbury's) and it was served freezing cold (\""sorry that's how it comes\"" was the response)! To rub salt into the wound they had the audacity to add 10% service charge which I refused to pay.\n\nBreakfast is little better and consists of:\n1. Orange juice. No other choices.\n2. Toast and marmalade. No other choices.\n3. Tea or coffee.\n3. One option from the menu. E.g. Porridge or Granola or Eggs Benedict or Tomatoes on Toast or Poach Egg on Crumpet, etc. If you want extra then it's \u00A399 (yes you read correct) and a 45 minute wait. Look at the menu I posted.\n\nWorst of all, Mr. MPW was dining in the restaurant on both nights and therefore acutely aware of what is being served but is quite happy to see his customers fleeced and go away so disappointed.\n\n3 Michelin stars, ha, he doesn't deserve 3 Michelin tyres.\n\nOn checking out I asked the receptionist if they get many complaints? She just shrugged her shoulders and said \""yes, a few\"". I returned the shoulder shrug and said \""that's hardly a surprise\"".\n\nWe stayed in the main house (room 7 - the one with the 7 stuffed crows).

I asked if I could not have the curry sauce but was told it came in it. Hobson's choice went for pheasant.

The hotel is beautiful with so much to see in the different lounges and wonderful photographs on the walls of each room and the stairs.The downsides are as follows the dim lighting throughout the hotel which means your unable to read a book either in the lounges or bedrooms or even see the menu in the restaurant.This also made it difficult to make up or for a gentleman to shave as the lighting was also very dim in the bathroom although the bathroom was beautiful it only had a bath, a Victorian roll top and just a hand held shower attachment. We stayed in the main house with 10 bedrooms, but there is also a more modern building close by Treetops with many more bedrooms 38 I believe but if you stayed in there you have to walk up the driveway for meals etc. In the main house there are no tea and coffee making facilities in the bedrooms we were told this is because of the chance of the expensive furniture being damaged! Also no TVs anywhere in the main house at all. I believe both these facilities are available in the treetops building. I advise taking a laptop or an ipad to watch TV in the bedroom of the main house if you want to.No house phones in bedrooms either.\nRe the food all very nice but not an awful lot of choice and the menu does not change on a daily basis and was the same for both nights we stayed. You can upgrade to the steak for \u00A312.50 supplement which we did but it was so small i mean the smallest steak we've had in our lives! 4 very small mouthfuls and it had gone. Chips were \u00A33.95 extra per portion too and a bottle of sparkling water \u00A34.50. Breakfasts were nice but if you don't like eggs well nothing much else.

Had no wine but I've read cheapest is \u00A39.50 glass or \u00A338 bottle and that's cheapest.we enjoyed it but with the few extras we had to pay in supplements the 2 nights cost us with meals over \u00A3355 so to be honest it was certainly an experience but we're unlikely ever to return.much preferred the meals at The Meriden hotel which was also a Marco Pierre White restaurant with more choice and an amazing steak too.All in all as I say an experience and a beautiful building but... \n",4,positive

The food, as you would expect from MPW, was excellent and the wine list was amazing, although pricey, and this can certainly add to your final bill significantly.

Unfortunately there was insufficient hot water to fill the bath, there is no shower so rather than make a fuss I decided I would have a bath in the morning. This was not the case as the bathroom floor was flooded, there was a leak, on reporting this I was told don't worry it is not your fault! and that they had noticed the water coming through the ceiling. This was not acceptable. The room was terribly hot making for a very uncomfortable nights sleep, the radiators just would not cool down.\nThe 6 course evening meal was apart from the crumble quite frankly one of the worst meals I have ever eaten in a restaurant,  tiny mouthful of pea and ham soup was rather like warm mushy peas! My 3 boiled egg starter with a runny so called truffle mayonnaise was bizarre why would you give someone 3 boiled eggs!! The haddock kedgeree was missing haddock and tasted like curry powder had been added to some rice! oh served with another boiled egg !

We then went back to the main house where we had our prosecco and explored the house. The best way to decribe the house is quirky! The decor is different in every lounge, it's not your 'standard' decor which I think is why there has been negativity towards it. You are able to explore the grounds which was nice to be able to go for a short walk around, we booked our meal for 8pm so we had time for a drink before. The drinks menu was expensive but when you then compare to other hotels that are not a chain you will see similar prices. We had the 6 course menu which were big portion sizes and we found every one to be of amazing taste and quality, the staff were all welcoming and very attentive. \nFor breakfast the next day we arrived early as was told that there is always a busy rush around 9am so didn't want to be part of a crowd. There can be extra supplements to pay but as we got this deal as a Groupon we paid the extra supplements, as we saw it as you wouldn't be able to go anywhere for a 6 course meal for 2 for \u00A3100 or less and to then be able to stay over night within that price an added bonus.

First night took over three hours for everything, second evening slightly less but we skipped tea\u002Fcoffee etc just because didn\u2019t want to have to wait half hour for it. Don\u2019t know if kitchen were telling them to slow down or whether it was MPW\u2019s chance of you buying more drinks.\nDrinks were extortionate - \u00A37.50 for a small beer and \u00A39.50 for a wine. Ouch! No one asked if food was ok but just left to it. Everything has a surcharge \u00A312.50 for steak which was mediocre considering it\u2019s a steak restaurant and \u00A34.50 for sides. Thankfully dessert made up for it - choc mouse was nice (both nights). \nNo salmon or bacon for breakfast. Could have a full English for, as you guessed, a surcharge. If you had the audacity to ask for extra it was \u00A399 surcharge and 45 minute wait. Obviously it\u2019s a money making scheme but hey, it\u2019s MPW so why not. \nLoud staff arriving to work, thankfully we were awake but at 7am two arrive on motorbikes which they\u2019re revving then have a full blown conversation and cigarette right outside our room; laughing and shouting at 7AM!!!\n\nI would go again if wanted to be close to Bath as good price on Groupon but wouldn\u2019t want to eat elsewhere probably. Overall it was different as enjoyable room more than anything else. Well done to the morning and reception staff. Evening staff - cheer up!",3,negative

There is no kettle just a coffee machine, no mirror to dry my hair, toilet takes 4 attempts to flush anything away and the TV is portable sized. There is no bar in the hotel, you have to ask a member of staff but the prices are extortionate at \u00A339.50 for the cheapest bottle of wine (\u00A39.99 online.)

Like others when we arrived reception was difficult to find and unfortunately the staff had to show each person round the hotel prior to dealing with the next person which meant quite a wait.  The grounds were beautiful but needed maintenance as all the trees were overhanging the footpaths. The tasting menu was rather bizarre with far too many additional supplements. The portions were large and the food was not of exceptionally good quality which was extremely disappointing  as one of the draws of staying here was that it is owned by Marco Pierre White. The meal however it was enjoyable but there was no flexibility. It says on the menu to say if you have any allergies, which I do have. They were unable to offer anything other than chocolate with coffee which I thought was rather disappointing. Breakfast the following morning was also disappointing I ordered muesli and received a massive bowl of shop bought granola  (pretty sure it was from Lidl) with a tiny bit of yoghurt and honey on the top. My husband ordered the soft boiled eggs with mushrooms which were much better.  Service was okay but nothing special. The male waiter was wearing jeans which exposed a significant amount of his pants at the top which wasn\u2019t what I wanted to look at over breakfast. I am not sure why the women are put in such strange uniforms. On the positive side the room was great. We stayed in the Annex and had a fantastic bathroom and shower and exceptionally comfy bed.\n\nOverall we really enjoyed our stay the food was the biggest disappointment.  The room, and bed were the highlights. Overall it was good value but I would want to eat out  elsewhere if I returned.",4,positive

Compared to the main hotel no pictures, walls are patchy,our room was small, previous occupants remnants, only 1 hand towel, dusty broken furniture mineral water was a nice touch. The restaurant a bit like a canteen (Wagamamma). I don't think you should have to pay a supplement for potatoe. Not a 6 course, an amuse bouche of  is not classed as a course. It's 3 course + coffee: starter, main, dessert & coffee. All our courses were delicious.

Nobody there to greet us so eventually found the dining room, have to hang your coat on the back of the chair in what feels like a canteen. After waiting ages eventually our \u00A337.50 bottle of wine arrived (one of the cheaper ones). Soup was okay but a little salty, more waiting until my pate and my wife's meat platter arrived.The Pate was quite nice but the meat platter could have been made up from a selection from a farm shop, nothing special. At this point my wife wants to leave. More waiting so we then top our own glasses up as none of the staff are coming over. Thought we would go for the steak (\u00A318.50 supplement each) and that comes with mushrooms and spinach. It would be nice to share some triple cooked chips (\u00A33.95). More waiting and eventually the meals arrive, my steak was chewy but my wife's was okay however the dominant flavour was salt. The triple cooked chip had not been cooked three times and again lots of salt. We need more water due to the salt, that come as just water, no ice, lemon or anything extra. Well we did only ask for water! We have been there over an hour by now for really average food and an expensive bottle of wine. After complaining we asked for the bill, neither of us could face anymore so we ordered a taxi. The bills comes and they have automatically added 10% service charge but on the other slip they give you the option to tip again if you are not looking carefully.

I will try not to make this review so long you fall asleep but this is one odd establishment and a few words will just not reflect our visit.\n\nArrived on clearly a busy weekend.  Very leafy, attractive, if narrow approach to hotel.  2 different name signs outside hotel very confusing, not sure if one is old or one is about to be adopted as new. \n\nReception is an odd room to the right of hallway, one high bar reception counter, no chairs anywhere so anyone waiting to be checked in was asked to go sit in a living room until reception was available.  Ok no problem with that.\n\nAll staff were extremely helpful and welcoming but very oddly dressed.  Not sure which but like an old english wench or an old french kitchen maid (excuse my ignorance) whatever the uniform was meant to be I don't think it works, particularly when the male staff wore jeans\u002Ftrousers and jumpers! Now that is odd but more about that later, all very casual didn't think that worked either.\n\nIf you're still awake and reading..... we were given a guided, brief, tour around the hotel.  The interior is very dark and weird in parts.  The place is stuffed (literally) with stuffed animals, bodies, heads, fishes, ok if you like looking at or sitting in an old science lab of specimens, no thanks.\n\nThe walls are filled with fantastic art.  I think mainly by Terry O'Neill, these for us were definitely of interest.  A ton of music history captured forever in stunning photographs plus countless actors\u002Factresses.  Yes there are some 'exotic' images but to us not offensive, very creative and beautiful.\n\nWe were given a small suite in a separate building, it was a bit like being in a basement with french doors as the main entrance was on a floor above us.  The room was tired with stained, torn carpeting but was spacious, good size tv and sofa and chair.  There was a decent size fully fitted kitchen but it contained nothing other than 2 teaspoons, cup and saucers etc for 2 persons and yet another fancy coffee machine that Mr George Clooney would be pleased to see but unfortunately no instructions on how to use it and rather than break it, we left it alone!\n\nThere was a king size bed which was extremely comfortable.  The ensuite was tired with cracked tiles but functional.  \n\nThe suite\u002Froom would have been great if it had just a few little details.  For example, there was a hairdryer but no sockets situated near a mirror so drying\u002Fstyling hair somewhat time consuming moving between position of socket and mirror. In the bathroom no hooks so the only place to 'hang' your towels, clothes, dressing gown etc was to fold on top of toilet, a simple hook is all it takes.\n\nOk I'm sure you have now been asleep and hopefully if you've poured a coffee I will continue with the bar and dinner in the restaurant.\n\nThe bar is a small, even darker, uninviting long narrow room.  The bar staff serve in the restaurant (as well as cover reception) so the bar is unattended.  We did seek someone out to serve us a drink whilst waiting for our table.  Sorry need to correct that, we were expecting a 'table' for 2, but what we got was school\u002Fcanteen\u002Fprison style refectory tables, long rows one after the other so you were effectively sharing your table with at least four other people whose conversations you could very easily hear without trying to listen.  I therefore felt very conversation-wise inhibited for that reason.\n\nThe menu was a six course tasting menu.  I have to say we both enjoyed the meal, it was plentyful and tasty, infact we couldn't manage dessert.  Wine is a bit steep. averaging \u00A340 a bottle.  I mentioned the odd uniform earlier, the waitresses were in this old kitchen maid outfit but the male staff ordinary clothes, this just didn't look right at all, surely it's all or nothing.  The service was good so no complaints about the staff, they were all delightful and clearly stretched and overstretched running this hotel but all done with a smile and even making time for pleasant exchanges of chat.\n\nBreakfast was good, but to have to pay \u00A35 to upgrade to a full english seem odd.  Mainly every item was egg based with eggs on the side.  Small print at the bottom of the menu - this is the best - if you decide you are not full from your eggs with eggs and you wish to order a 'second' meal you will be charged the princely sum of \u00A399 and an imposed wait time of 45 minutes.  Now try explain that?  So if you have a large appetite or sometimes like to try a couple of dishes - Mr M.P.White has clearly warned you of the financial consequences of doing so.  Mentioning yet again the uniform, the male waiter was extremely helpful but seeing his candy striped underwear clearly showing above his low slung jeans and his high backed jumper was not a good sight first thing on a morning and again an odd outfit not fitting in with the lovely young ladies who were still in their floor length dresses ( I doubt they even got to bed or had much rest as it was the same staff from dinner service)\n\nSo to sum up, would we stay again? No not unless we hear there has been some upgrading.\n\nWas it good value? Yes we thought it was but there were too many oddities that just didn't sit right with us.  \n\nThe place would benefit from the presence of a Manager. There was no manager visible either on dinner service or breakfast or any time inbetween.  If  there was a manager in attendance he or she did not display the appearance\u002Fauthority a manager usually exudes, only the staff meeting themselves coming backwards trying to handle reception duties and service duties.  Shame, the place has all the ingredients of a great hotel just needs bringing together and attention to detail.",3,negative

However our room was spacious and attractive, the only minor complaints were no bedside lights, curtain not hung correctly and resulted in quite a large gap on one side. The smoke alarm was positioned over the bed so that we had a flashing light reigning down on us! Having said that the bed was extremely comfortable and the room very clean. We were given this overnight stay with breakfast and six course tasting menu as a present to celebrate our 50th Wedding Anniversary and were particularly excited about sampling the food. How disappointed we were. Firstly, it was not a tasting menu as we have ever experienced. We were given two anchovy canap\u00E9s each, followed by a pea and ham soup - both quite acceptable. We were then asked to choose starter, main and dessert from a very limited choice menu. I chose beetroot and goats cheese for my starter - the goats cheese was obviously in short supply! For my main, I chose pigeon which was served with garden peas, The gravy\u002F sauce was so salty as to be almost unpalatable and the peas swimming in butter. My dessert was more like an off the \ncounter supermarket concoction. The staff were extremely helpful but obviously under pressure as there were not enough of them. Hefty surcharges for the steak menu which my husband chose and considering the extra cost he was not impressed with the dish. Breakfast - no fresh fruit, no cereal and again a hefty surcharge for cooked breakfast. The service was really, really slow and the second night we decided to forgo the coffee and chocolate as we\u2019d already been sitting there for 3+hours!

The omelette at breakfast was also wonderful but I couldn't quite get my head around the \u00A399.00 that you would have to pay if you wanted an additional breakfast to the one that you had already paid for! The drinks at dinner was the worst advertisement for 'Rip Off Britain' that I have ever witnessed and they faced some pretty stiff competition. 200ml of Coke was \u00A34, that's half a can. A 300ml bottle of cider, that you can get in any supermarket for \u00A32, was \u00A37.50. There is no justification for charging these prices, except for the fact that they have a captive audience who need a drink with their meal. Wine prices were extortionate, they couldn't even bring themselves to put the exact price on the menu, they used 57.5 instead of \u00A357.50. The rooms were 'different'. Our room had a broken window, which was propped open, so you couldn't close it, the other window didn't open at all! I had to put the fan on all night to keep the room cool. Check in\u002Fout is less than impressive. There is one till, so we encountered a long queue on check-out and you had to stand and listen to the receptionist detail all the other customers bills, 99% of which were for the extortionate drinks charges that they ran up at dinner. I'm not a skinflint but I draw the line at paying \u00A34 for half a can of Coke and then being charged a 10% service charge as well.",3,negative

I was absolutely dreading staying here after reading some of the reviews however I can honestly stay this place is amazing. I booked it for my boyfriends 30th birthday.\nWe arrived on Friday 10 May. We were greeted by lovely staff who explained everything and showed us to our room in the treetops building with a glass of fizz. The room was nice, quirky and in need of a few touch ups here and there. The bed was amazingly comfortable. We explored the building which is simply wonderful. Such a collection of art and fascinating things. I\u2019ve read that people have complained about the lighting. It\u2019s the ambience of the lighting that makes this extra special. The grounds we\u2019re slightly over grown but still looked lovely. We sat down to dinner in the restaurant at 8 and had finished all six courses by 9.30. Yes there is a surcharge for steak, yes the drinks are expensive, but what do you expect from a place such as this? Most people staying had purchased the discounted deals. You didn\u2019t have to choose those options. We had 2 rice balls, pea and ham soup, pate, fish cake, chips \u00A33.95 extra, cheese, coffee and chocolates. The food was amazing. The staff were lovely! The following morning we had eggs Benedict with toast, tea and orange juice, again absolutely beautiful. We left for the day to explore bath and returned in the evening at 8 for another six courses. I picked beetroot and goats cheese salad, turkey Milanese and cheese again. Another wonderful meal and we were finished by 10.  The following morning again, a brilliant breakfast. There were a few chipped plates, big deal!

11.43\ca\209966\291137\674456880.html,Rudloe Arms,"""Spent two nights with my wife in this lovely area having found an attractively priced package which included two breakfasts and six-course dinners.  With a lovely old building with adjacent parking spaces and attractive grounds in a beautiful area, plus the promise of great food, this should have been a wonderful experience.  Indeed, the location was very pleasant and convenient for visiting Bath and Wiltshire attractions.  The room and bathroom in the main house were very large and the staff generally friendly.  The decor in the house is very unusual, with a vast number of artworks on every wall and all unused spaces.  I welcome this quirkiness as something different to experience even though not all the items appealed to me.\nHowever, the dinners were real let-downs.  Very limited selection (without paying almost \u00A310 extra for venison) and both starters and main courses were rather unexciting and lacking seasoning, so very bland.  Meals at home are far better!  Adding sides (such as thick chips or a vegetable) adds \u00A35 to the bill and wines started at \u00A335 per bottle with most over \u00A340.  To make matters worse, the service was so slow that on our first night, it took three hours from arrival to completion with 55 minutes wait between canape and starter and the restaurant was very hot, dark & smoky from the candle illumination by 10pm.  We were almost dreading the second night but hoped there would be a better menu and faster service.   Unfortunately, apart from a couple of starter adjustments, the menu was largely unchanged and while we placed our orders for tea after 2\u00BC hours, this took a further 25 minutes to arrive!  We were clearly not alone with these issues for although we merely queried the whereabouts of our food a couple of times, others were being far more vociferous with their complaints and guest discussion afterwards was a comparison of times taken to be served.\nFortunately, breakfasts were much better with an interesting menu choice and quite tasty although limited to one hot dish choice plus toast, orange juice and tea of coffee.  (NO big buffet selection with fruits, pastries, cold meats or cheese etc. here.)   It was also served in reasonable time.\nOur room was very comfortable with good bed and chairs.  Bathroom was immense with a freestanding bath and hand-held shower, but no possibility of having a stand-up shower.  There were only two double power sockets in the room and these took some detective work to find behind furniture and all were used by table lamps.  Therefore, to plug in a phone charger (for example), the furniture had to be pulled away from the wall and table lighting disconnected.  A hair drier was provided, but with nowhere to plug it in except the above procedure, and then this was nowhere near a mirror.  A battery radio was provided, but with no available power, there was no TV (no problem for me) and no tea-making facility.  The latter was an issue, for with exception of breakfast & dinner, there is no opportunity to find tea or coffee.  Two bottles of water were provided each day, however.\nWhile friendly, the staff were often difficult to find, particularly at meal times, since there were few of them and they all helped out in the dining room (but still not enough in the evenings!).  To check out, it was necessary to wait by the kitchen until a member of staff could be requested for reception.\nSo, two out of five for a few positive aspects, but overall a great disappointment and I could not recommend this hotel to anyone.  During our stay, renovations were nearing completion and the hotel was preparing for a relaunch under a new name.  However, the core problems with the restaurant and some room facilities will need to be addressed first if this relaunch is to be successful.",2,negative

Cheapskate Groupon (Wocher actually, this time) again.\n\nOur first ever visit was not long after MPW acquired the place, and the Treetops rooms were still furnished in the way the outgoing owners had left them. Alan Partridge conference hotel chic, as it were. \""I'm a tigerrrrr\"" (Some of you will get it).\n\nSecond time, the old house decorations were were finished, Treetops rooms probably 50\u002F50. Penultimate time was December 2018, Treetops again, raised Ground floor done. And yesterday, 3rd floor Treetops room, done. \n\nI don;t know what MPW plans for the future here, but I suspect his willingness to entertain Groupon\u002FWowcher guests may well be on the wane.\n\nSecond-guessing his strategy, he acquired a tired old place with an equally tired annexe (although that was only built in the 1980s\u002F1990s), and  funded the works by offering cut-price deals, hoping for a bit of give and take from the guests in the process: he provided top quality, albeit rustic, meals throughout, while the rooms could be hit and miss.\n\nNow it's close to the rooms being up to standard throughout the property, this weekend felt like he's paring back the food offer to reflect the voucher deals (no drop in quality, but quantity and choice), before I suspect relaunch at a higher price point.\n\nThis was the first occasion we felt we got what we paid for, compared to previous occasions we felt we got more than we paid for. No complaint:  finally reaching equilibrium, as per the review title.\n\nYou're thinking \""what's he trying to say?\""... OK, let me try and explain via the current menu:\n\n6 courses: 1) Arancini - two small deep fried mushroom risotto balls per person  2) Pea and ham soup (this has been running for a while) 3) Pate or Beetroot and goat's cheese salad or Charcuterie (salami and air dried ham) or one more I've forgotten. 4) Main course: a) Steak (3 different sauce options) at \u00A312.50 supplement, b) Fish cake c) Turkey and ham pie or d) some veggie option.. but ALL the mains came with sauteed mushrooms and spinach on the side 5) Dessert: a) Apple crumble or b) Chocolate mousse or c) cheddar and crackers or d) rice pudding. 6th course? Coffee and chocolates.\n\nThe filet steak was  - at best - less than 100gms (don't forget, \u00A312.50 extra), chips another \u00A33.95. and of the four main course options (steak, fish cake, veggie option, turkey and ham pie) ) one came with a stiff supplement, another was, well...veggie, and all came with the same accompaniments.\n\nSo I'm moaning about the size of the steak, but for balance I admit I left the table full, satisfied, not wanting for more food. I'm 19 stone, with a good appetite. There was enough food.\n\nSo he's streamlining the food offer, after a few years of - in our opinion - delivering more than he was charging for, to finish the final renovations push. That's what I think is happening. \n\nInterestingly, the \""full English\"" breakfast was bigger than on previous occasions, therefore worth the \u00A35 supplement.\n\nBar prices remain steep, no question about that.\n\nAll this adds up to a qualified recommendation: if you think anyone is going to deliver you a Henry VIII size banquet, bed and breakfast, and fill your bath with champagne or ass's milk (no, not ass milk, potty mouth) and fawn adoringly over you for the price you paid on Groupon\u002FWowcher - please, get real. The man is allowed to make a living. I say it's still worth every penny.\n\nIf - on the other hand - you would like to experience food quality (I challenge anyone to cook spinach, for example, better than this kitchen) and a night or two in a quirky country house environment and access to millions of \u00A3\u00A3\u00A3s worth of 1980s-2000s original artworks, for pretty much what you would pay for dinner, bed and breakfast in a Travelodge, then you still can't beat this.\n\nCatch it while you can, I don't think the Groupon\u002FWowcher association will last much longer.",4,positive

The bed looked lovely but was very soft. I was disappointed not to have a bath but the shower was a generous size and the water was hot. Bottle of shower gel, shampoo, moisturiser and soap were provided. The room had a kettle and decaffeinated coffee (none with caffeine) and four tea bags, along with 4 little pots of milk. Also two bottles of water. There was a hair drier but no mirror. The extension lead did reach in to the bathroom but obviously this is not ideal. Unfortunately, the weather was on the chilly side when we visited and our room was freezing.\n\nThe food  was a little disappointing. The menu was very similar on both nights. The starters and puddings were the same, as were three of the mains. The other three were steak the first night and venison the second, all with around a \u00A312 supplement.

The menu describes what you would think to be exotic and fancy food, so you can imagine my shock when the opening canap\u00E9s was served, and was nothing but a date wrapped in a fatty, undercooked piece of bacon\u002Fham. This was one of the most disgusting and strange flavours I have ever tasted, and did not expect such poor quality. Then the second course was served, this was described as a ham and pea soup, but what it actually was, was a Luke warm bowl of mushy peas and the fatty cut of ham chucked in, even worse than the canap\u00E9s. Thinking it could not get much worse, we ordered the 'mayonnaise truffles' thinking this would be some fancy entree only to find out they were three COLD boiled eggs with some weird sauce on top (did not taste like mayo!). This was the third course and we sent back every single one (every single person on our table sent back at least 2-3 courses of food). The fourth course was a medium rare steak, which came out practically blue. Dessert, we had dark chocolate and sprinkled nuts, which was so rich, not enjoyable. Then apparently a coffee is a sixth course meal (Luke warm). I am not a negative person and I don't like giving bad reviews but when I have to pay \u00A3165 for a bowl of slop, a poor excuse for a canap\u00E9, a blue steak, poor quality moose, Luke warm coffee and an extra \u00A35 for a service charge it really takes the biscuit.\nIf Marco Pierre has truely designed these meals, then I have no idea how he has got \nwhere he has got.

Friends of ours who were also with us, had previously done the 2 day deal in January 2019 and enjoyed a lovely menu with variety each night including game.\nBearing in mind the place is owned and run by Marco Pierre White we expected something akin to fine dining, something we wouldn\u2019t\u002Fcouldn\u2019t cook ourselves and much like other tasting menus we have experienced at establishments run by other top chefs.\nWe were dreadfully disappointed with the food. We emailed a couple of dietary requirements in advance. This was acknowledged but the staff on duty were completely unaware and no provision had been made at all to cater for these. No substitutions were offered.\nThe first 2 courses were a slice of sausage roll with a horseradish sauce and a small cup of pea and ham soup. There was a limited choice of starter and main course, none of which we would normally have chosen and most of which my husband was eventually told he couldn\u2019t have due to the ingredients. Mains consisted of steak with a choice of sauces at a supplement of \u00A312 and it wasn\u2019t even fillet. The other mains were Fishcake, turkey pie or Polenta. On the second night we were given exactly the same menu except the starter soup had changed. We had another slice of sausage roll, another cup of pea and ham soup. We struggled to find something the first night and all hope of fine dining completely disappeared at this point. None of us wanted to eat the same thing again so most of us opted to have the fishcake, only to be told there was only 1 left. We were then offered Kedgeree. That is a breakfast dish. We complained but weren\u2019t offered anything else so we ended up ordering Kedgeree as we couldn\u2019t face another turkey pie. \nThe Kedgeree consisted of a pile of curry flavoured rice with the grand total of a teaspoon of flaked smoked haddock in it.\nIt wasn\u2019t good. \nDesserts were rice pudding, apple crumble, chocolate mousse or a piece of cheese with a few biscuits. where was the effort in this. We would have liked a creme br\u00FBl\u00E9e or souffl\u00E9. \nEverything was based on very cheap limited ingredients.\n\nBreakfast consisted of eggs done in various ways. There was a \u00A35 supplement for a full English. Needless to say they had their own chickens!! Breakfast took 45 minutes from ordering on both days and they all went back on the first morning because the poached eggs were solid. The replacements came within a few minutes so why did it take 45 minutes otherwise. The toast with breakfast was basic supermarket bread- nothing homemade in sight.\nThe cheapest bottle of wine was \u00A337.\nThe house was a lovely old building but most of the grounds were a complete jungle. Our rooms were in a separate, newer building, currently under part renovation. Whilst the rooms were a reasonable size, our bathroom was mouldy with a rusty blocked up shower head. The grouting was black with mould and the shower shelf rusty. The tray did not drain properly.\nThere was thick dust in the room and cobwebs. There were french doors but no windows and as we were at ground level and near the road, we had to ask for a fan because it was too hot at night. \nWe had the pleasure of being woken at 8am by the workman renovating the room next door. \nWhen any issues were raised with staff, there was an arrogant attitude towards those guests on the deal except for 1 member of staff who apologised about the solid poached eggs.

Yes, the beer is 7.50 for a 330ml, but consider it the entrance price for this little museum in the countryside. Oh, and we even bumped into Mr White himself twice!

Bought as a gift on LivingSocial, an overnight stay with 6 course tasting menu in the Treetops Annexe.  On arrival we were greeted straight away into the main house, very quirky, with lots of 'sitting rooms' with large comfy sofas, random pieces all around, lots of art and pictures.  Room was not ready as check in not til 3pm, and bar not open,  so we drove into nearby Corsham, lovely little village with nice pubs and shops.  Once we had checked in we were shown around the house and where everything was, we went to room on main floor of the annexe, room was lovely, clean and fresh bed linen, with window\u002Fdoor that could open with the juliet balcony, bathroom clean and tidy with shower gel etc and big white towels.  We overlooked the side, so could see the black saddleback pigs through the wooded area, which was nice (was hoping there was no pork on the menu after that !)  Dining room, was busy, quite dark and hard to see at times but used the candles for light which I supose is the whole vibe, as its an old manor house and that's what would have happened back then.  Menu was limited but enough to choose from, yes there were supplements, but you can choose whether or not to pay for those.  The canape, the sauage roll, was tasty but could have been plated differently, the amouse bouche pea and ham soup was lovely, starters we had the english meats and the avocado and bacon (sorry pigs), both very nice.  Mains were the steak (supplement but worth it apparently) and fishcake, again both lovely, puddings, rice pudding and apple and almond crumble, again both lovely.  The wine was pricey, but then again my choice and again very nice.  Breakfast was the best, attentive staff, great food, and in a calm dining room, we had eggs benedict, with fabulous sauce apparently, and the scrambled eggs and mushrooms, which randomly had a poached egg on top !.  Overall we were very surprised considering all the negative reviews on here.  Only criticisms, are the grounds around Treetops need some TLC, but it seems they are doing some work there as there were 2 skips, and could do with some outdoor seating to enjoy drinks around the main house.  If you are after absolute fine dining, white table cloths, silver service etc then this is not it, (try the Ritz) but this was a lovely stay with dinner.

We spent a little while walking around the grounds and then enjoyed a few drinks in one of the multiple lounges. We were also delighted to bump into Marco himself in the restaurant. \n\nWe had booked our dinner for 6:30 and were surprised how many other guests were staying at the hotel on a Tuesday, it provided a good atmosphere.\n\nDinner was very good, 6 courses consisting of two entrees, a starter, main and dessert of your choice and then coffees, teas and truffles enjoyed in one of the lounges. We both had the cured meat to start and the turkey escalope with a side of chips for main followed by apple crumble. We were not disappointed with any of it. The only criticism is the service to start was a little slow but once we had our starters everything flowed. \n\nIn the morning we went down to the restaurant for breakfast. We had eggs benedict and tomatoes on sourdough toast which were both delicious.\n\nWould highly recommend this beautiful peaceful place.",5,positive

Perhaps the alarms bells should have been ringing earlier (why was a Marco Pierre White establishment offering such seemingly amazing good value packages through Groupon\\Wowcher?) but I only investigated the reviews as the date of our stay approached and started to have some concerns.  The use of vouchers in this case is no doubt due to the renovations the hotel is undergoing - try to keep the place filled during this period until they can bring in the desired clientele (paying full price) who will then be provided with a comprehensive a la carte menu.\n\nHotel itself quirky and interesting - re other reviews, artwork \\ grounds.\n\nRoom - adequate (not impressed by clean linen as per other reviews - expect this as a minimum).  Missing bedside table draw handle \\ grubby shower.  Perhaps the room itself was one that was intended to be renovated and our bad luck to be staying in it beforehand.\n\nFood - awful.  A small slice of sausage roll does not constitute a course.  Main course, as many other reviewers have noted, was very limited - 6 choices with 3 carrying supplements.  The turkey escalope almost a joke - I can go to my local cafe, get the same thing served with chips, pay a few pounds and think it was adequate and be satisfied.  If I go to a Marco Pierre White restaurant and get served this as the main course I'm as far from a state of satisfaction as I'm going to get.  Other reviewer's comparison of this dish to a turkey burger not far off.\n\nThe second night presented with the same menu.  First in the restaurant but others being served in front of us - waiting for the fishcakes which we'd chosen for main.  Yet again 2 fishcakes sailing by us to go to other tables and we came to conclusion that there was little point being ignored and waiting for a meal which neither of us were really looking forward to anyway.  Got up, walked out, checked out, came home, fixed myself something to eat which I actually enjoyed - much happier. \n\nThe staff overall were in the main pleasant and the lady who checked us out was extremely apologetic about our negative experience - due to the courtesy of this lady I am rating the stay 2 rather than 1.\n\nMy recommendation to other people thinking of staying - buyer beware, if an offer seems too good to be true it's for a reason.  Set your expectations low (very much so in terms of the food) and you may enjoy your stay.",2,negative

We could not fault any of the food, from the canape and amouse bouche to the coffee and chocolates at the end of the meal. So many reviews painted a very grim picture of the food we began to wonder what we let ourselves in for but it was a very pleasant surprise. The service at the start of the meal was most attentive, however as the evening wore on and the restaurant filled up the staff did get considerably slower and seemed somewhat unsure who they were serving. In no way would i describe any of the staff as 'surly' as described by one reviewer. The choices were very good though it was disappointing to see some foods with quite a hefty supplement. Perhaps the supplements could be removed and smaller portions of those dishes be served as 'tasters'. Quantities were most satisfactory and we felt did not warrant needing to add the 'extras'. The drinks were rather expensive but with the prosecco and table water it was not necessary to purchase any.\nThe one thing i would have liked to see improved upon is the lighting. While it may have a romantic feel to the occasion it was difficult to read the menus. As the evening wore on the blinding torchlights from mobile phones were a nuisance. Lights which could be controlled by dimmer switches would have been a good idea. Being a Friday evening it obviously attracted more people and parking was an issue. Overall a super evening.

I totally concur with the other negative reviews from August 2019 and will definitely not be returning. I am amazed by the polar positive reviews and suspect they may be in house reviews!

The welcome is delightful and the house itself an extraordinary blend of home from home and art gallery.  The black and white photos on the walls vary from interesting, Peter Sellars adjacent to the Kray twins, to the bizarre, a half naked Marco Pierre White with a fag in his mouth and a huge fish across his thighs, and the frankly obscene.  The paintings on the walls of the dining room certainly provided us with a topic of conversation during the long wait between courses but I would not want any of them on my own walls.\n\nOur room was in the annexe and was spacious and comfortable.  There was a huge walk-in shower, which was a delight, and there was one enormous armchair which was very comfortable for whoever managed to nab it first.  The loser had to sit on the bed.  The drawback was the lack of wifi in our room but there is a poor 4g signal.  The TV is large but the signal to it is poor so that the picture constantly broke up and pixilated, but we hadn't gone to watch TV.\n\nThe six course tasting menu was, mostly, excellent.  Why though would a Michelin starred chef produce a tasting menu that is virtually the same each evening?  It cannot inspire his sous chefs.  There are several courses with supplements but just enough to choose from that you do not need to pay for them.  The first evening we were served slowly but not excessively so.  The second evening the wait between courses seemed interminable and we resorted to playing games on our phones to distract us from our hunger.\n\nBreakfast was delicious but there is a five pound supplement for the full English.  The coffee was excellent.  Woe betide you though if you are hungry and want a second helping.  The menu warns that there will be a forty five minute wait and a supplementary charge of NINETY NINE POUNDS!!\n\nSo in summary, go.  It is a fascinating place.

Amazingly,for  only  an extra \u00A360 we got a second night, with another two meals included. So far, so amazing for value.\nThe hotel is in a lovely area, with large grounds, and some lovely views.\nThat said, the decor is very much an acquired taste. The corridors,bedrooms, and lounges have many stuffed or man made animal heads peering at you through the gloom. Weird paintings, and semi naked photographs hang from the walls, and there are no TV`s in sight.\nOur room had a radio, no TV, and no tea or coffee making facilities. Neither did it have any ventilation. It did, however, have a telescope to admire the beautiful view of the countryside. Assuming, that is, you could see through the filthy windows. The outside ledges had dozens of spikes to ward off the many pigeons that plague the area. Our bathroom had two tiny windows, one completely covered by ivy, the other partially so, When I opened it for much needed ventilation a pigeon came in within minutes, so it had to be partially closed. There was a nice bath, but the only means to shower was to stand or sit in it and hold the shower head over yourself. No screen or curtain!\nCorridors have very practical coir carpet, but that is not very cosy when extended to bedrooms, as it was in our case. Internally, everything was very fresh and clean, although the bed was the smallest double I have slept in.\nOn to the food.\n\nThis was delicious, although exactly the same menu on both days.\nWhere Marco obviously makes his profit is on the drink mark ups.\nA small beer is an eye watering \u00A37.50, with a glass of prosecco  \u00A312.50!!\nMore strangeness at breakfast.\nAs we entered the dining room we looked around and could see no cereal, no fruit, and no cakes\u002Fcold meats, etc. That`s because there were none.\nWe were asked if we wanted a glass of orange juice, and given a menu. This was basically hot food, with a mostly egg\u002Fmushroom theme. A full English was available with a \u00A35 supplement. We had eggs benedict, which was perfect. We were given sliced bread toast, with a slab of butter and a small pot of marmalade.\nI assume it was Marco`s little joke, but a note at the bottom of the menu states \""another breakfast will cost \u00A399 and a entail 45 minute wait\"".\nI spoke to a couple in the cheaper rooms and they had a coffee maker and a TV! They also had a bath with a seperate shower.\n\nAll in all, an unforgetable stay. It is great value if you go for the food, but not if you like alcohol with it.",3,negative

My main came with jus splatttered across the sides of the plate.  Only two of us yet no recall of who had ordered what.  The staff speak the words but with no feeling.  No eye contact or integrity.  \n\nCutlery- maybe they\u2019re short of it.  Side dishes came without serving spoons and whilst it didn\u2019t matter and I could have asked I was interested to see if anyone would notice.  We\u2019d not drunk our complimentary  tepid and unpleasant Prosecco.  Nobody noticed that either.  \n\nBreakfast - you get one glass of orange juice - no bits.  Tasted like carton juice.  And you get to choose one item from the menu.  No More!  Eggs Benedict were fine though personally I expect a slice however small rather than a couple of stamp size pieces of ham. My other half likes fruit before a cooked breakfast.  This was not possible. \n\nWe had a \u201Csuperior\u201D room in the annexe.  Recently refurbished and sporting lovely Mouseman furniture as is the dining room.  The bedside lights have no cord switches so I had to stand to turn my light off and my arms are probably longer than average!  \n\nOne mirror and that\u2019s in the bathroom yet has no light over and the overhead light - well I thought it was an energy saving one that took time to warm up.  It wasn\u2019t.

I think this is a result of the floor covering so unavoidable. \n\nLastly - it was really hot in the room.  Open the window ?  Ground floor near the entrance and only the french doors opened.  With pigs and poultry nearby I was wary of accompanying rodents strolling in.

It was a dilapidated old coaching inn back then and had been deteriorating slowly since, until the current owner took up the enormous challenge of turning it in to a charmingly authentic and luxurious boutique hotel.\n\nThe double bedroom with en suite shower was top quality and beautifully presented. Actually it was more like a suite as it had a separate TV \u002F lounge too; a massive bed, sumptuous Egyptian cotton sheets and a great night\u2019s sleep to boot. My only negative was an unfortunately positioned smoke alarm that blinked above the bed. \n\nWe didn't have an evening meal although the restaurant looked inviting and full, always a good sign. Breakfast was top notch. I had full English with all the trimmings and complementary paper - peaceful, energising and nourishing. What more could you wish for? \n\nI believe the Hotel had only opened a few weeks before my stay and there were signs of work-in-progress which I can assume have now been tidied. The price of the Bed and breakfast was very reasonable for the superior quality and I would definitely recommend a stay, business or pleasure. I will be going back, that's for sure.",4,positive

We were given a room upgrade, complimentary wine, dinner and champagne! Amazing, even though it was not the hotel's fault, they more than made up for laterooms mistake.\n\nSo we only spent the Friday and Sunday at the hotel but what a fabulous two nights. Felix was so very helpful and found us accomodation for the Saturday night in the next village.  This worked perfectly as we spent the day in Bath and we returned late to the other hotel.  A nice place but not half as good as the Arms.\n\nThe next morning we returned to  Methuen for another tasty breakfast of pastries, juices and a selection of cooked food. The omlette, fresh muffins and full english were our favourites.  We then spent a glorious lazy Sunday eating and drinking our way through the fantastic menu.

I phoned the Methuen Arms before I booked the room to confirm that they have rooms available, I was told that there is one room available at \u00A3140 b&b for Sunday night, I did not give my name nor did I book the room direct.  On terminating the call, I immediately booked the room on Laterooms for \u00A3100, got a phone call 30 minutes later from Feliks the Manager and was told they have problems with Laterooms and that the Inn was fully booked, but they could offer me an alternative b&b further down the road on a farm for \u00A375 per night.  I explained that I phoned earlier and got confirmation that there was still a room available, he suddenly changed his tune and told me due to my earlier phone call my name was double booked for two rooms (how could it be as I did not give my name in the first place).  I got the idea that they wanted to sell the room at \u00A3140 to someone else and did not want to give it to a Laterooms booking, in the end I got the room.\n\nArrived there late Sunday afternoon, the room is spacious and bathroom lovely, was taken to our room by Feliks the Manager and was told if we need anything we just need to phone reception.  We wanted to surf the internet and when we tried to phone reception for the password we discovered that the room did not have a phone, there was NO information leaflet in the room to inform us when check-out was, from what time we could have breakfast or even in the event of a fire, which would be the quickest escape route.  Decided to have a bath, just to discover pubic hairs from the previous guests in the bath, on closer inspection it was obvious that the bath was not cleaned at all, got the evidence when I cleaned it myself with a white facecloth, which ended up being a caramel brown once done.  This is a lovely place, but it miss that small touches, such as a mattress protector over the bed, a waste bin in the room, milk with the coffee and tea facilities (the other half had to run down yet again to reception), a telephone in the room, information leaflets, a toilet brush in the bathroom etc.  This is definitely not a five star establishment yet and if we had to pay the full price of \u00A3140 we would have been pretty upset.  We told Feliks, the Manager, all this and his response was that they welcome feedback like this and that they are still in the beginning stages of establishing the Inn, well then don't advertise the Inn as a five star b&b and charge \u00A3140 a night, maybe you should lower the prices a bit, until you have everything in place.",3,negative

Interesting menu, with plenty of flavour, fresh ingredients and interesting combinations - and nice sized portions too -  enough, but not so much as to be off putting! Good wine list. The atmosphere in the bar pre dinner was great - enjoyed a few drinks is easy chairs looking out at the lovely village view outside.

We arrived and were very pleased at the lovely building and pretty courtyard.  At the reception we were checked in quickly and shown to our room.  We were given room 2, which has a lovely separate bathroom but is at the front of the hotel.  Immediately it was apparent that there was substantial road noise.  The hotel is on the main road through Corsham and it is very busy.  I went to reception and said I was worried it was noisy and explained that I was a fairly light sleeper and did not want to be in a noisy room.  The gentleman assured me that the noise would stop completely later and that I shouldn't be concerned.  With that we accepted the room and set off to explore Corsham.  We had dinner at the hotel that night and as mentioned in previous reviews, it was wonderful.  Every course was delicious and the service was great.  My only grumble was that they would not make up a sauce that wasn't on the menu and to be honest I was a little thrown by the explanation that the chef was too busy, as I have never been to a restaurant where additional requests have been denied before (more expensive and less).  I assumed that given their prices this would be a given.  However, it did not ruin the meal and a lovely night was had by all.  We went up to our room at about 10:30pm and had expected a great nights sleep as there would no longer be road noise.  However, this was where I was most disappointed.  The road noise did not stop until around 12 and the noise from the bar, which was very loud, did not stop until gone 1am.  We paid the top price in the hotel and had expected to be able to get to sleep but this did not happen.  To make it worse, the road noise started again at about 6:30.  Not a good nights sleep!  We asked for breakfast in our room the night before and were told no as their linen contract did not allow food in the room.  We were again disappointed, as this is what my husband and I always do and given the price we had paid we assumed that this would be fine, sadly not.  The breakfast was lovely and the black pudding was beautiful.  In summary, the hotel was beautiful to look at, had great bathrooms and amazing food but it was a rubbish nights sleep and I am unsure if I would return.  The receptionist told us that we should ask for a garden room next time, personally I think an appology and the promise of a free upgrade or a bottle of bubbbly if we returned would have been more appropriate!",3,negative

Dinner was less so - mostly down to one particular server who argued with my (soft spoken) wife about the contents of her drink (soda water added vs tonic), forgot (ignored?) a request for green veg for our children and again omitted to note down our request for ice cream vs cream with desserts.

I had to start with both a small starter platter of haddock goujons with tartare sauce and the home cooked parsnip soup with parsnip crisps which was absolutely delicious.\n I followed this with a sirloin steak on the bone which was not only very tender but full of flavour which is not something you usually find these days - I understand they hang their own beef and meat in their own cold store while it ages.\nFor desert I tried their panettone bread and butter pudding with maple ice cream which was to die for.

Looking online and noting the Alastair Sawday connection we called and found we could have a 'snug' room for one night and a larger room for the second.  Wary of what 'snug' might mean in practice we arrived at this architecturally elegant hotel in the centre of Corsham to find that 'snug' was comfortable and would have suited us for the two nights although the larger room on the second night was certainly more spacious.  \nAll the staff from front desk onwards were welcoming and professional.  The bars were warm, relaxing and comfortable.  The restaurant was very, very good with the kitchen was visible for those wanting to see the apparently clean and efficient preparation of food.  A serendipitous find for us, again proving that it is an ill wind....etc.",4,positive

We were really pleased upon our arrival and greeted warmly by the friendly staff on a busy Saturday lunch. We sat in the bar and had our first meal and a bottle of wine. I had the steak sandwich and was asked if I wanted crisps or coleslaw with it. For me at the price charged both should come as standard if not with chips! That said it was very tasty. My wife had a ham sandwich and again tasty.\n\nWe then went to our room, we were in room 11, we were very happy with the room, very well decorated with a lovely bathroom and complementary shower products. Free wifi and a decent wall mounted TV. Tea and coffee making facilities with shortbread. \nWe then had dinner on the Saturday night and we had the Ch\u00E2teaubriand, it was cooked beautifully and tasted divine, but there's a but. It cost \u00A350 (enough to for two) but did not come with any side orders, for \u00A350 I believe that it should come with all the sides and then some. \nBreakfast was very good, a good selection from the table plus cooked  items from the kitchen. The homemade blueberry muffins were yummy.\nWe went for a walk around the nearby park and ended up walking 5 miles and passed the nearby Hare and Hounds pub. As it was Sunday lunch it was busy but we found a table and enjoyed a pint and some light snacks, worth a visit.\nDinner on the second night was in the bar area as the main restaurant was closed, a little disappointed as its a nice area to eat. I had the fish and chips for dinner and again I felt a little short changed, the cod fillet was cut in half and as a result not a very big portion. However the fish was nicely cooked and very enjoyable. My wife had the homemade house burger which she really liked. \nThere's a good selection of wine at a reasonable price.\n\nThe staff were all really friendly and easy to talk to and are a credit to the hotel. \nThe hotel is still going under some renovations and I would like to return in the future to see how's it's changed. \nI really enjoyed our visit to the Methuen Arms where we celebrated our wedding anniversary, my only negative comment would be the value for money on some of the dishes. Just a little more generosity on some of the dishes would make the diner feel more satisfied that there getting value for money, in my opinion.  \nBut like I said all food was very well cooked, served by really nice people in lovely surroundings and ambience. The room was lovely and I look forward to returning. ",4,positive

This general comment about the need to go just that one step further is my only criticism of the hotel and in particular the food supplied by them.\nThe food was not cheap but well priced and I just felt that corners were being cut especially in the size of the portions. For example on one evening I had the fish and chips. It was well cooked but the fish was just that bit small.\nThe rooms were excellent we stayed in luxury room 11 and it had its own bath in the bedroom which was well received by my partner especially as she could watch the television at the same time.\nThe decoration of the room was good but perhaps more pictures on the wall would make it more homely.\nTo me what made the hotel special was the staff who all went just that bit further to make your stay worth while.\nThoroughly recommend the hotel for a short stay but would suggest to the management that they think about the small things that could just push this hotel into the excellent category.",4,positive

A large rambling but interesting and well presented Inn serving locals and visitors in the bar. After spending the week in a small cottage the bedroom seemed enormous. It was smart but showed a few signs of wear. Unfortunately we had the curse of the room above the kitchen extractor which meant noise late into the evening and wafts of garlic into our bathroom. The dinner menu was a bit quirky but it turned out the quality of the ingredients was very good. I had wood pigeon and beetroot to start and salmon with seaweed and vegetables. My wife (who always says the real test of good food is the dessert) was very happy with her passion fruit coulis and coconut ice-cream.\n\nService would have been very average but for the sterling efforts of our waitress, Chloe, who sourced us new potatoes that were not on the menu (instead of the ubiquitous chips), chased our drinks order without the need to remind her and dealt with my query about the choices of 'cider brandy' by delivering tiny samples of both so I could decide. The Full English breakfast was very good with some of the best unsmoked bacon and black pudding I've had. Overall a well presented Inn and garden, with good food and certainly worth a night.",4,positive

Eventually, -15 minutes later - leaving 7 of us without a drink - the manager came down to settle the matter and resulted in refusing to serve any more of us and told us to leave. This is a table of eight perfectly polite and paying customers that were told to leave due to refusing to pay the best part of ten pounds for a flat drink!

We had to wait 45 mints and it had very clearly been reheated in the meantime, and, as a result was barely adequate. \n\nThis is particularly disappointing considering this was such a wonderful place to eat in the the past.\n\nThe decor in the rooms and the quality of bathroom fittings remains excellent and the bedding and general level of comfort was good.

As there were four in our party we'd booked two rooms and were given ones on the first floor almost directly opposite each other (4 and 5). Both were of a good size (5 is slightly larger and has a free standing bath and walk in shower. There was a slight issue with the loo that required some persuasion to flush and as another reviewer has remarked the drone from the kitchen fan was noticeable but not unduly intrusive) Both rooms were very well equipped, warm and cosy with a welcome tray including delicious home made biscuits) Being able to collect fresh milk from reception was an added bonus (there is a fridge in the room0. Toiletries in the bathroom were of good quality although the addition of a shower cap would have been welcome!\n We had dinner in the restaurant, which it being Saturday night was pretty full - unsurprisingly given the quality of the food, which was outstanding. My red mullet starter was one of the best starters I can remember in a long time. The wine list was comprehensive and very reasonable. Breakfast the following morning was also excellent with an interesting choice of dishes such as smashed avocado and goats cheese on toast with poached eggs alongside the more traditional full English etc.. and a good selection of fresh croissants, chocolate pains etc..\n What really makes this hotel so special however is its staff. Everyone we came in contact with without exception were unfailingly cheerful, efficient and seemed intent on ensuring that every guest enjoyed their stay. Many thanks to all concerned for a wonderful weekend. Can't wait to return!",5,positive

There was a note indicating that there was no hotel staff on site overnight between 000-0800 and we should familiarize ourselves with safety procedures. Furniture was worn and tired.

The only challenge we had was with parking - a very small car park for somewhere fairly large. I think some railway sleepers to help define space might be helpful as much of the frustration came from other drivers who had left too much space between cars but not enough for another car. We managed to squeeze into a space. The public car park next to the pub was for a maximum of 3 hours and we were at a wedding so that wasn\u2019t a possibility for us. \n\nThe room was compact but lovely - if not a little rough around the edges. Bed was comfy and the desk fan was appreciated if a little ineffective. \n\nBreakfast was a mixed affair. The food itself was good (but please add beans into your cooked breakfast!) but the young staff left a lot to be desired. \n\nSimple training would do them the world of good - like picking up dirty crockery on your way past and setting tables once they\u2019re vacated would really help keep the breakfast room looking good. The young waitresses could certainly be reminded to walk with a level of urgency without rushing around. Their sluggish walk was a touch irritating, especially when it took 15 minutes to take a drink order. A smile wouldn\u2019t go a miss either. \n\nKudos to the lovely bubbly lady with blonde hair that morning who rescued the service. Perhaps the young staff aren\u2019t morning people but in hospitality you paint a smile on and increase your energy levels to make guests feel welcome. \n\nOne of the issues with being kept waiting in the morning is noticing all of the cracks. Literal and metaphorical.

Which over 3 weeks later has gone unanswered and is very rude not even to acknowledge. Read on for a bad experience...\n\n\u201CFAO Manager\n\nHi Methuen Arms\n\nUnfortunately I am writing with some feedback from our stay on 12th October at the hotel. Whilst I travel for work pretty much every weekend, this was a social trip with my partner to visit my Sister who has just moved her family to Corsham, and we left feeling very disappointed with what could really be a fantastic place to stay.\n\nI must point out I have never felt the need to send an email directly to any hotel or accommodation I have stayed in over the years, but thought it was fair to highlight our experience with you directly before leaving a review on booking websites, and give you the chance to respond. \n\nUpon arriving at the hotel we were unsure where to check in, so asked in the bar. We waited for a short while, and grabbed the attention of the girl serving drinks in the bar as there was nobody on reception. We were given our key and the girl politely asked if she wanted us to show us to our room, but we said that was fine as we had just passed it in the courtyard. No problem, but there was no clear indication of \u2018could we have dinner here, what time breakfast is served\u2019 etc. A very busy evening being a Friday I am sure but that is very basic.\n\nWe found our room to be small for the \u00A3150 cost, but not bad and understand that you have a tariff for rooms. The noise from the exterior door and people stoping around was unfortunate but I understand you can\u2019t do anything about this, it just was never relaxing in the slightest and louder than our London ground floor flat.\n\nWe had a drink in the bar which was lovely and the best part of our stay, before grabbing a table for dinner. A good atmosphere and busy probably reflecting your excellent decor and cosy nature of the downstairs pub.\n\nWe didn\u2019t feel very attended to for dinner, in fact had to ask for cutlery even after the food was placed. It seemed like you were massively understaffed, whilst understandable for any restaurant there didn't seem to be any manager on duty, or one that was attentive to guests or helping guide what seemed like brand new staff. We were pretty surprised and shocked when we were told there was no wine left (!?!!) on a weekend at 2000. The member of staff explained something to do with the brewery, which makes no difference as for anywhere to have simply run out of wine is not good enough. \n\nWe were given a choice of a white pinot or rose, so we ordered a bottle of the pinot, only for the girl serving to come back 10 minutes later and explain in fact it was something different and only enough for one glass. Pretty laughable I am sure you agree. This sadly set the tone. \n\nThe food was brought out, and whilst very good food, the staff didn\u2019t clear plates or at any single point check if everything was OK, offer another drink, or bring a desert menu. We waited and waited but didn\u2019t see any staff for so long we gave up, and went to the bar ourselves to let them know to put the bill on to our room. At which point the staff member behind the bar yawned and didn\u2019t say thank you or any sort of professional communication to let me know it was done which was incredibly rude. We passed what I thought was a manager in the hallway on the way back to the room but to be honest, he looked so unhappy I didn\u2019t know if he worked there or not!\n\nBreakfast followed up on the disappointment and non attention to detail. We sat down at 9am, which being a Sunday kind of assumed the breakfast would be readily available until 1000 as advertised. We were given a table (with no cutlery, cups or menu.) When given a menu by the waitress, we ordered toast and said we would have hot drinks and the continental breakfast from the table. There was no yoghurt left, a tiny scoop of the homemade granola, no pastries at all and no water, juice available. \n\nWe did ask if there were any more pastries due to come out, no was the answer. Really!? On a weekend with so many guests asking, was pretty embarrassing for any hotel or restaurant. The breakfast table was not replenished and I had to get up and take two cups from another table who hadn\u2019t used them just to drink the tea we asked for, as the staff didn't bring one. \n\nAt check out we were presented with the bill, and not once did the girl working as if I was happy to pay the full amount or even \u2018did you enjoy your stay?\u2019 These are the absolute basics, totally missed, without a smile.\n\nWe felt this could have been such a lovely stay in Corsham and your hotel has the potential to be excellent, but these things really let it down and did in NO way reflect the \u00A3150 a night tag. Whilst trying to be a spin off of Soho House and other higher end hotel and pub stays and providing such excellent food, perhaps the basics have been missed especially at weekends this is far from a good review sadly. We went back to London feeling more annoyed than relaxed.\n\nI would love to hear that you have read through this message and can kindly respond with some explanations.\u201D\n\nI wouldn\u2019t recommend staying here just for the cosy appearance.",2,negative

Our soup starters were fine, could have been a touch warmer perhaps but otherwise enjoyable. However, when we realised other diners who had arrived much later than us were being served main courses or desserts while we were still waiting for our own main courses we realised something was amiss. After a lengthy wait a member of staff advised us that the 'ticket' for our meals had been lost and they would be served shortly. About ten minutes later they arrived but with no potatoes or vegetables. We asked for these and a portion of potatoes and veg for one person was brought to the table about five minutes later. Enquiries revealed that if you order a fish dish on a Sunday potatoes are not served and the only vegetables offered is the small amount of garnishing that the fish comes with. When asked if we had enjoyed our meals we pointed out that the loss of order and lack of accompaniments had been rather disappointing. At this point a small reduction to the rather hefty charge was made. The fish, when it came, was actually very tasty but I'm completely baffled as to why they are not prepared to serve it with potatoes or a few vegetables.

On arrival, Helen was welcoming, explained everything to us, advised what we could see in the charming, unspoilt and typically English village of Lacock and was most interesting in conversation.  The cottage is compact, but extremely clean, comfortable and well equipped with everything needed for a self-catering holiday. There is always a concern that you won't get a good night's sleep when you are away from home, but no chance of that here - the bed was extremely comfortable. The children loved the bunk beds too and the individual lights at their heads!  The shower over the bath had good pressure and worked well. Outside there is plenty of space in the grounds surrounding the cottages for children to play in a confined, safe environment.  I wish we had had decent enough weather to sit out on the patio!  However, that did not detract from our enjoyment and all in all we had a lovely break here, able to explore the beautiful Wiltshire countryside - there are some outstanding villages to see, Lacock included.  I hope we may return one day, either to a cottage or to experience the renovated B & B.  We wish you all the best with it.  Dianne and Ian",5,positive

If we hadn't eaten in the restaurant in the evening I would have said it was an excellent hotel.  However we did eat in the restaurant and it was not a pleasant experience.  I had booked tables for both nights we stayed.  On Good Friday evening the restaurant was not busy with only three tables occupied, but we had quite a long wait to order.  The food was good though and overall it was a nice evening.  On the Saturday evening it was very different.  Admittedly they were a little busier, but ..... We arrived at the booked time and were directed to our table.  No-one came to ask if we wanted a drink and no-one brought us menus.  There was no-one around to ask as they were all behind the bar, so my husband went to the bar to order drinks. After 30 minutes of sitting at the table we finally managed to grab someone to give us some menus. After another 15 minutes (at least!) we were able to attract some attention and asked if we could order some food and finally a few minutes later a waitress arrived.  Sadly they didn't have what I wanted (either of the two starters I would have liked) and my main course was mediocre and not really worth the wait.  In the end I wished we had gone somewhere else, or at least not bothered with booking a table and simply ordered at the bar, as it seemed people doing that were getting much better service than we did!

Our rooms were delightful, with a view of the village \u2013 how lovely to wake up to!  The only fly in the ointment was the lack of hot water, which was due to a fault with their systems. However, we were told that the plumber had been called, and the fault was speedily fixed. Certainly the water was hot enough after that! We had a delicious meal in the restaurant, but alas were too full after the main course to attempt a dessert. Shame as they looked scrumptious. Beds were very comfortable. I slept like a log.

11.43\ca\315994\305932\115090808.html,The Red Lion,"""The Red Lion has five guest rooms so one could expect to be treated more than just a commodity. Sadly that was the first impression my wife and I received when we were greeted at reception. It was a beautiful warm afternoon, but a distinct chill hit us upon arrival. \n\nWhether the lady who showed us to our rooms was having an off day, I know not, but the regimental march upstairs to our room interlaced with instructions of access should we be out after 11.00pm certainly dampened our enthusiasm for booking this place. I remarked that this would be unlikely - in an effort to make friendly banter - but this was met blankly. I was also quite surprised that no offer of assistance with our luggage was forthcoming. I don't know if this person was part of the management, for the simple reason that over the three nights we stayed, not one member of the management introduced themselves, or made any attempt to ask us if we were comfortable. \n\nI would not expect such personal treatment if I was staying in a large impersonal hotel, but as I said, the Red Lion has only a handful of rooms, and whilst it does a roaring trade with day visitors, one would think that the resident guests would receive a little more consideration. It's most unfortunate that the woman who checked us in was the same three nights later that attended to us at dinner. Her behaviour was the same. Yet her attitude to a large group of diners (who she seemed quite familiar with) was completely different with warm attention. I even had to find her after 15 minutes to give the order, because I thought we were being neglected. She was there again when we checked out, but by then I was not in a conversational mood, and was just keen to settle the bill and depart.\n\nI also find it remarkable that they advertise a large car park, but do not make any allowances for their staying guests, who have to fight for a space along with everyone else who are just on a day trip. Be under no illusion - the Red Lion car park is huge - and assuming they know how many rooms are booked, surely they can reserve a space for them. It could only be a maximum of five spaces required if the hotel was fully booked.\n\nOn a positive note, many other staff were very friendly. In particular one who served us breakfast each morning and serviced our room. She, together with some of her colleagues, was the saving grace of this place. \n\nIts location is perfect, the rooms are excellent, and the food is very good. I'm not a particularly demanding guest, but I expect to get what I pay for. At  \u00A3100 per night for what is effectively bed and breakfast, the management needs to be less blas\u00E9 and connect more with their guests. \n\nI will be returning to Lacock next year with eight relatives from the USA who are very excited to experience the village. I\u2019m sorry to say that the Red Lion will not be part of the itinerary due to my unfortunate negative experiences. Nevertheless, I would not wish to put others off from visiting, this is merely my own personal observation.\n\nIt is a charming place in a charming location. Unfortunately there was little charm cast from the management, whoever they may be. First impressions are really important and the Red Lion needs to concentrate on that. A smile and a friendly gesture doesn't cost much, yet can make all the difference. \n\nWe didn't pop in for a pint and a ploughmans - we stayed for three nights. Maybe accommodation isn't regarded as the core business, but thats no excuse for indifference.",3,negative

The bed was comfortable and the en suite had an excellent shower with lots of hot water and nice extras. The Red Lion is ideally situated to explore the whole of Lacock on foot - two minutes from the Abbey and other attractions. \nHowever, I would not stay there again. We booked a table to eat there in the evening. Standard pub grub menu (nothing wrong with that), but the scampi was over-cooked, the chips were soggy and the petits pois were swimming in something. And how bizarre to get a sprig of rosemary on the side?! Our waitress was sweet 'Hello guys, can I get you guys a drink?', but had no idea about the wine list and when we asked for the Montepulciano she said 'is that the one that is difficult to say?'. When we ordered a glass of wine to come with our starter, and a different one with our main, we were told we were 'dead posh, aren't you - wine buffs', and were then brought all our wine in one go which meant the white had warmed up by the time the main course arrived. We're not wine buffs, but we at least have a clue! The food was really mediocre, which was a shame as the pub environment was pleasant enough.\nThe next morning (after the clocks had gone forward an hour) we were woken by really loud music in the bar below at 7.45am (so body clock = 6.45am!). Clearly no consideration for guests. I later asked politely if this could be avoided the next day, however yet again we were woken on Easter Monday at 7am by loud thumping music below and had to telephone the main reception to ask for it to be switched off as we would not be having breakfast for another hour and a half. No apology - just told it would be switched off. Breakfast was very generous with a massive Wiltshire full cooked affair and other nice cooked options. Sadly the lady serving on Easter Saturday kept disappearing, leaving 3 sets of guests sitting around waiting for service - not that she minded, cheerfully shouting 'I've just been peeling spuds, my lovers!', rather than prioritising the service of her customers and keeping her other tasks to herself.Then when we went to pay (got a deal through LateRooms so \u00A392 per night B&B) we were charged \u00A3337, which included charging us for 3 nights instead of 2, and adding a \u00A310 ploughmans to our dinner that we hadn't ordered.

After a tour around the local village and the Lacock Abbey we enjoyed a very tasty Dinner and in the morning a wonderful breakfast.\nWe took advantage of a special offer which gave us the room, breakfast and dinner for two at \u00A399. This was very good value and something we will make use of again. Lacock is that type of place and the Red Lion that type of place to stay! \nAll of the staff we met were friendly.

My wife and son had sandwiches which they were very pleased with; I had a ploughmans and although the cheese selection was excellent, the accompaniments weren't great: the advertised pickles and chutneys didn't make it, and the celery sticks were buried under a mass of undressed salad leaves.

It was very well-equipped, with a TV, kettle, a wide selection of drinks apart from the usual tea & coffee; hairdryer & even an ironing board hanging at the side of the wardrobe. The impression I got was that it was set up to cater for guests who may want\u002Fneed to stay longer than the occasional night. The bathroom had a bath with shower above and was invitingly warm.

We both slept unusually well, and could have lingered a little longer in bed on the Sunday morning. Unfortunately, breakfast is served between 8.30-9.30, so no chance of a Sunday lie-in.\nThe breakfast was impressive. As well as a well-stocked buffet table with the usual cereals, yoghurt, fruit, pastries and juices, an enormous plate of bacon, sausage, egg, beans, tomato, potato rosti and mushroom set us up for the day, so that we skipped lunch! The service at breakfast was the same during our entire stay: prompt, unfailingly helpful and friendly. They were happy to provide more hot water to top up the teapot, toast and tried to help in any way they could.\nWe also enjoyed dinner at the Red Lion the night before. The lamb was delicious, literally falling off the bone and my friends were happy with their meals too. The men particularly enjoyed the service at the bar and being given tasters of different beers before they ordered their pints. \nThere was so much to see and do in Lacock that we spent the whole of Sunday in the village, returning to the Red Lion for a cream tea in the afternoon. Once again, the food and service could not be faulted. However, I felt really sorry for the staff because there were a lot of disgruntled customers who were waiting 1.5 hours for Sunday lunch and complaining loudly. \nThere was obviously a problem in the kitchen and the chefs couldn't keep up with demand. It was so different from our experience the night before when we were served very promptly, but it had been nowhere near as busy.\nAll in all, I would recommend a meal and a stay at the Red Lion.

It\u2019s a long time since my hand ached whilst trying to cut something.  Parts of the serving was marginally chewable, but most was exceptionally tough and was not edible - it was left on the plate.  Staff did ask, initially, for comments on the meal, but this was on the delivery of the mustard; hence before I\u2019d sampled the meal.  The vegetables were perfectly cooked, the roast potatoes were mediocre and tasteless and the gravy was - what my wife calls - bisto gravy.  When the plates were collected, I complained and was expecting an offer of not paying for the beef meal or - at the very least - a reduction in price.  I received an apology, but this - in itself - does not mitigate a spoilt family experience.  It will be a fair while before my family returns - there are plenty of other places in the area to experience a wonderful Sunday roast.

We choose the pub restaurant because it seems to be the only place open for food all day.  I ordered the goujon fish sandwich, and my partner fish of the day.  One bite of my sandwich told me something was very wrong.  The fish had a really \""off\"" strong smell, and when I opened the sandwich it looked like the goujons were days old with grey fish under old looking breadcrumbs, and they certainly did not smell fresh.  I sent it back and searched from something vegetarian on the menu, the veggie lasagna was available anymore, and with very little else to choose from I succumbed and ordered the mushrooms in Ciabatta.  To be fair they did turn up very quickly but, again I wished they hadn't, the mushrooms were pale and unappealing swimming in a sea of tasteless butter and cream sauce and plonked on 4-5 thin 2\"" slices of cold greasy hard ciabatta. With loads of Parmesan cheese. Probably the most unappealing looking and tasting meal I have had in a long time.  Entirely unimaginative, bland full of fat and tasteless, not worth the inordinate amount of calories in all that swimming fat and cream on greasy bread.  I didn't have the heart to try anything else, so set about the chips to stave off the hunger. Sadly those were also totally disappointing, they were soggy and fluffy, and not crispy at all.  My partners fish of the day didn't fair much better, and was covered in greasy batter with the same disappointing chips.  The tables were sticky and the restaurant felt old and unloved, happy to leave and didn't bother with desert.

We were greeted with spotless, newly completed accommodation (it is a conversion of the old working mens club) and a very comfortable room with a huge bed. We took a three minute walk into the centre of Lacock and had a welcome pint and an excellent meal in the George which we would highly recommend. After a great nights sleep we ate a lovely breakfast and spent time talking with Andy and Fiona who are fantastically friendly and welcoming hosts (and particularly engaging if you have any interest in photography).

The ensuite bathroom is likewise neat and super clean. Breakfasts are really excellent and there`s plenty of it.

Comfy beds, spotlessly clean, warm and very dark at night, Lacock has few streetlamps (the wind up torch in the desk was a great touch). The bathroom was wonderfully clean and warm, loved the underfloor heating. The shower was just right too. There was a good choice of drinks in the room including bottled water. The Border biscuits were also very well received. I loved the milk in a mini flask, such a cute idea. If you are looking for a Tudor bed for the night this isn't the place for you but I am a fan of modern yet incredibly stylish. The website details the rooms' photographic themes which is very fitting when you visit Lacock Abbey and as Alan and Fiona run a photography business from their home next door. As for our hosts, we could not have felt more welcome. They have thought of everything. Breakfast was superb with ample choice for anyone. The highlight for me was Hamish, their 5 month old wire haired miniature dachshund. He was adorable. I was half tempted to smuggle him into my case on the way home. Checkout was effortless....I hope my payment went through in the end Alan?!

Our room was in the coach house which although classed as a 'cosy' room was superb with a thermostat on the radiator and a fan for summer months as there is nothing worse than being too hot and not being able to do anything about it.  We had a scrumptious afternoon tea which was all home made and was very special.  The breakfasts and candlelit dinners  were also to die for and compliments go to the chef.  Most important of all was the superb service and professionalism by all of the staff - the best we have ever had, and made our stay very special.  Unfortunately on Saturday night and Sunday morning there was a party which included some extremely badly behaved children who ran riot up and down the corridors on the wooden floors sounding like a herd of elephants screaming at the top of their voices which somewhat spoilt the ambiance of a romantic candlelit dinner.  However, there are lots of little rooms which the hotel utilises for meals and breakfast and dinner guests were allotted one of these which helped to drown the noise and keep the illusion of a more genteel bygone era.

Now to the food, it was exceptional, the service, the way the whole day was ran was outstanding. Everybody loved the meal which we suited to our own tastes not just off the menu, they were more than happy to comply with our suggestions. The food received nothing but compliments!

We especially liked the attention to detail for our room set-up ie., by not insisting our 2 girls slept together on the same Z.bed - thanks so much :)\n\nThe location is very handy for visiting Bath and the grounds and the actual hotel building are beautiful and very impressive.\nCheck-in was smooth and friendly and our room was ready a little early so a good start.  \nThe sun was out so we all hit the pool which was incredibly busy (school hols!) but such a nice feature to have.  Not enough sun loungers to go round but we didn't really mind.\n\nThen we returned to the room and started to get ready for dinner.  The room itself had a lovely super-king bed (bliss) and all the furnishings were of a high standard.  It was very stuffy due to the hot weather and there is no air-con so we just had to make do with the little fan provided and kept the windows open.  The bathroom was in need of a little TLC - it was very much 3* standard and showing lots of sign of wear & tear.\n\nWe did have high hopes for dinner as the hotel's website boast an impressive menu...but sadly our expectations were definitely not met.\nFirstly, the service was not great.  The young kids who were serving were very pleasant but not very effective.  Yet, this wasn't really a problem and I was happy to go just ignore and go with the flow.  That was until the food arrived...\n\nI don't want to sound mean but that Chef should be sacked or at the very least - re-trained!  Basic skills of cooking fish, getting eggs right and seasoning correctly were sadly lacking.  Even the easy kids meals were not up to scratch.\nI'm not sure of the lady's name who tried to help us find a solution to our food problems but she was polite, understanding and eager to fix it quickly for us so top marks to her!\nAt the end of the meal, the full price for everything had been charged (nearly \u00A390 for 2 x poor kids meals and 2 x poor adult meals) which hit us hard as we were still hungry!!!\n\nAnyway, off to bed we went.  We had asked in advance, for a quiet room as my girls have difficultly sleeping and was promised this yet our room was on the first floor directly above the kitchen - so with all the windows open no-one really slept until about 1am and then we were woken again early in the morning with the same kitchen sounds (and smells!) so we were a little disappointed that no-one had thought about this.\n\nSo, would we return??

Chestnut had a lovely view over the garden terrace and pool, small balcony and very modern super bathroom - exceeded all expectations!

Amazing old oak bed, a little high for short people like me but very comfortable once I had managed to actually get in it! With regards to food I agree with some of the other comments a little poor although I only had a bar meal - I went for the bean burger which consisted and tasted like a tin of refried beans mixed with some other ingredients to form a burger so a little disappointing no actual whole beans, the bun was also too hard to eat. Very generous portion size, a little off putting for me but sure others would love this. A very nice glass of chilled Rose wine was enjoyed on the outside terrace. Service was a little slow, this may have been due to sitting outside but overall I was satisfied with my evening bar meal.

This was the case with every single staff member we came across. Whoever is responsible for hiring people at the hotel deserves to be congratulated on their fantastic team.\n\nThe room we stayed in was lovely, and easily big enough to accommodate the four of us. Although it didn't matter and it's not really a criticism as it was perfectly clean, the bathroom was in need of updating, with chips in enamel on the side of the bath and loo and the sealant coming away from the edge of the bath. The room had definitely been refurbished, so I suppose they must be doing the bathrooms separately. \n\nWe ate in the restaurant on the first night and found the food to be fantastic. The children were made to feel very welcome, and both had a burger from the children's menu, which was very nicely made and excellent value.  The breakfast was also a hit, and yet again, the staff serving it friendly and polite.\n\nThe pool was still open, even though it was the end of October, which was also lovely for the kids.

The venue was just perfect for us as it was exactly the right size and we were able to have exclusive use on the day. \n\nThe best thing about this hotel is the overall appearance. The rooms are beautifully decorated and really smart but also extremely classy and elegant. I am always impressed by any venue of this size that is smart and well maintained as well-used hotels can quickly look tired and tatty with constant use. \n\nOn the day, the fires were lit as it was a little cold outside and the whole place was cosy and cheerful. Another great feature of this venue is that if you have a disco\u002Fband in the evening, it is contained in the main room. This means that any older guests that don't want to listen to the loud music, can escape into the lovely front rooms that remain peaceful and quiet. \n\nAll the guests at our wedding that were staying the night commented on how lovely their rooms were and the grounds and gardens were absolutely spot on. The grass had been cut the day before and the place just looked so well cared for. The gardeners and grounds staff are clearly very hard-working and very good at what they do. \n\nAll of the staff were very helpful, attentive and appeared extremely well trained. Even the waiters and waitresses who were mainly young adults were very impressive and really seemed to be striving to deliver an excellent service. \n\nI have to put a special mention on here for the events coordinator, a man called Jean-Luc. This man is a consummate professional. His organisation skills and attention to detail are deeply impressive. His manner, his understanding and his coordination of the staff on the day were second to none and I think he was probably the main reason our day ran so smoothly. \n\nThe wedding breakfast was excellent considering their were 67 mouths to feed.

The heated swimming pool was excellent however the only downside is that there is no shade in the afternoon by the pool . The staff are friendly, helpful and make this hotel a pleasure to visit. My only hiccup to a perfect couple of days is that the wine we ordered was never in stock! This a great place to spend some time away from it all to relax in peaceful, stylish and luxurious surroundings.  Will be back.",5,positive

The grounds are beautiful  with an outdoor heated pool with towels available from reception and all the staff we met were polite and friendly. \n\nDinner (allocation of \u00A335 pp to spend on the a la carte menu included in the deal) was really good, tasty, well presented with good sized portions. When we arrived some guests were having afternoon tea which looked splendid also! Breakfast was cooked to order and was fine, especially like the toast and freshly squeezed juices! Be aware though that there were still young children in the restaurant gone 9pm and although well behaved and didn't bother us, some might prefer a more child free environment. \n\nNow the not so goods: We'd booked a Cosy room which was located in the coach house. The room was on the small size, not a problem though and the large bed was comfy with good linens. The tea tray had a good selection of teas and was replenished at turn down later that evening.  There were only two tiny windows but the lighting in the room was really dim so couldn't even see to put make up on in the bedroom mirror and the bathroom mirror was still running with steam 1.5 hours after two quick morning showers despite leaving the door open. Also we heard every movement from the people upstairs who seemed to be running a constant marathon around their room until  gone midnight and then again from 6am. This is not the hotel's fault but be aware that sound does carry in these coach house rooms if you're a light sleeper. Bathroom grouting could have been cleaner, the toilet seat was cracked and moved to the side when you sat on it.\n\nDespite the above shortfalls we had a lovely stay and would undoubtedly return , just not to the Coach house rooms!",4,positive

The ground floor still has a series of smallish rooms which makes it ideal for groups who might like to dine together in relative privacy.  There is an outdoor swimming pool and a pleasant terrace for al fresco dining\u002Fcoffee or just sitting and reading. We had chosen this idyllic hotel set in stunning grounds full of mature and unusual trees after which the rooms are named,  as a base for a day at the races in Bath  (an \""experience\"" gift!).  The weather was wonderful during our stay but this contributed to the almost unbearable heat and stuffiness in our room \""Hazel\"" on the second floor.  A fan had already been provided but was inadequate.  In a building of this age I accept the difficulty of dealing with this problem, but it did make our otherwise very pleasant room most uncomfortable.   The furnishings and d\u00E9cor were modern but in keeping with the house and aesthetically pleasing.   The bathroom was also very stylish but possibly  style overcame practicality - there was nowhere to put anything and the shower\u002Fbath need some grab handles for safety, as well as a few clues as to how to work it!\nWe ate in the dining room on both nights - the food was excellent and staff attentive, friendly  and efficient.   I was a little disappointed that the small menu was not changed from one day to the next - not even any specials - it meant that ones choices were  limited although bar food was also available in the dining room.  The breakfast buffet and cooked part were equally good.\nWe would recommend this hotel and would return when in the area.",4,positive

Everything was amazing, hotel staff, reception, cleaners and especially Jean Luc, the wedding planner. He was just fantastic, nothing was too much trouble, he never said no to any request we made of him. He sat down with us when we arrived and went through all the items we had and when and where we wanted them and at what time. He even helped me carry in all the contents of my car, took my cases etc., to the room and separated all the wedding items in a holding room. We had forgotten, until the last minute to go and see the florist the day before the wedding. Jean Luc phoned them for us and ask them to wait until we arrived! What service.  On the morning of the wedding, we used the bridal suite to get ready, myself, the bride, five bridesmaids, and two other guests, plus the hair stylist and make up artiste, who were also amazing,  The bedroom looked like a nuclear attack as we left for the wedding downstairs. I was dreading coming back to clear up. Two hours later I popped up to get something and it looked like the fairies had arrived. The room had been cleared, items put into tidy piles, towels and toiletries all replaced. Amazing.  Food was fantastic both on the day and also the evening before, waiters and waitresses were watching all the time, topping up glasses and clearing away at appropriate times. My little Grandaughter was asleep during the wedding breakfast and as soon as she woke up, Jean Luc noticed and went and sorted her meal without being asked.  The best part was that my Mum was not well enough to travel to the venue, but Jean Luc set up an Ipad in the ceremony room and face timed her and she was with us throughout the service and meal and speeches and we enjoyed her company for 4 1\u002F2 hours. We even gave her all the table settings, Buck's Fizz and flowers were delivered from the bride and groom. She had the most amazing day and so did all of us.  If you are thinking of having a wedding here, don't hesitate, the grounds are beautiful and the pool is lovely which many of the children managed to use the day before and morning after the wedding. My one small criticism is that air conditioning is required during these hot periods we are having, but saying that, we had plenty of fans in the bridal suite on the morning of the wedding, which did help.  Everyone of the guests staying at the venue commented on how lovely their rooms were. Thanks you to each and every one of the staff who played a part in making this a fantastic day for us, particularly Jean Luc. With best wishes from Bev, (Mother of the Bride).",5,positive

It is also close to Chippenham, Stonehenge and a nice drive to Salsbury.   The manor has been very well kept up but still reeks of everything we foreigners think is English.   We occupied 3 rooms and despite all being rather different, were each room was delightful in their own right.  The outside room, whilst being outside, was generous.  My room opened to the most delightful painted glass allowing one to ignore the fact that it also opened into the bathroom !!  The dinner we had was rather good (morning English an we had game sausage, rack of lamb etc), in fact better than the \u2018fancy restaurant\u2019 in Bath.  Breakfast was generous (loved the homemade muesli or should I say dried fruits with a sprinkle of museli).  However, for those use to modern hotels do please understand the place is old and thus will have its quirks.  Expecting these quirks is a lot of fun, a bit like expecting an eccentric relative to do the unexpected.  In my room\u2019s case, seeing the shower cover the bathroom floor despite my best efforts and hearing floor boards creak as my neighbors move around.  Quite comforting really.  The only real negative was that my colleague in the outer room said she could clearly hear the traffic from the rather busy road on which Beechfield is situated.",5,positive

It is beautifully furnished with some very pleasant places to sit and the grounds are lovely. \n\nThe hotel has benefited from extensive and high quality refurbishment in recent years and the standard of accommodation is now extremely good - notice that all critical reviews in this area are quite old now. We stayed in one of the cheapest rooms and were still impressed. The room was not too small by European standards and everything was spotlessly clean and high quality.\n\nThe restaurant is better than you tend to get in expensive hotels, where you're often presented with food that's fancy but tasteless; at Beechfield the Chef clearly knows what he's doing and the meat he selects is superb. The portions are sensible as well, so you're not overloaded with an obscene amount of food. \n\nService at the hotel was generally very good and we were particularly impressed with the younger staff, of whom there were many. It's a pleasure to see young people making such a good job of being warm, friendly and attentive to customers. \n\nI would recommend this hotel for people who want to experience a high-end stay in nice surroundings. For us, something intangible was missing, but we couldn't think of a reason not to give it 5 stars and I'm sure that for many people Beechfield House would be an absolute dream. Maybe it was the pretend open fires, or the fact that so many customers were standing on ceremony - I'm not sure; or perhaps we're just a couple of philistines who prefer somewhere a little more ordinary! All in all, I promise that the website doesn't lie and if you're looking for a comfortable country-house experience, you can't go far wrong at Beechfield.\n\nFinally, a helpful note for petrol heads: if you're arriving in a sports car with very low ground clearance, nip round to the \""deliveries only\"" entrance as the speed humps across the main driveway are pretty vicious!

Hi lights were the original stain glass window, wooden four poster and fabulous views from its commanding position at the front of the house.\nThe Cedar room was easily big enough to accommodate 7 of us for pre dinner drinks and birthday presents before heading down for dinner. \n\nAs a treat the restaurant team had booked us into the private room called the Library. \nThe room made a special dinner into a 'Really' special night. Great decorations and the intimacy of a private room really set the evening of at the right tone. Our waiter Jordan was super attentive and really knowledgeable in relation to wines and the menu choices, food and wines were all very good as other reviewers have said. \nThe night went like a dream and was over and above what I had even envisioned thanks mainly to the staff and hotel.\n\nHighly recommended for a special occasion and a treat. I would like to finish with a very BIG thanks to all the staff for making our stay and a special night VERY special. \n",5,positive

My wife is disabled and the staff went that extra mile to ensure that our entrance was painless and also the exit.Ramps were put in place to facilitate a wheelchair - its only a shame that with a little bit of work they could make this hotel completely disabled access. I must admit I had to find out what access was available by searching via Trip Advisor - the hotel web site was not helpful about access. This is unusual as most hotels specify their accessibility on their home page. I would have thought that as this hotel appeals to older people access would be an important asset . However the service for the funeral tea was impeccable and the staff very helpful, The food, and the range of the buffet was very good and the quality excellent. I was so impressed that I made enquiries for a family special birthday celebration next year. I would have liked to give this hotel 5 stars but the disabled situation and poor information on their web site were the factors that stopped me.",4,positive

Ash was the best , like a hobbit house in the old stable block. The staff were very helpful and always spoke when you met them around the hotel. The outdoor pool is lovely, big enough for a decent swim in beautiful surroundings. The night before the wedding we ate in the restaurant, the food was very good but the tables weren't very elegant. Breakfast was lovely, usual cold breakfast  products  served buffet style and hot items cooked to order. The toast is the best, lovely thick door stops, served whilst still hot! The wedding was a small intimate wedding for 30. We were looked after like royalty and had a superb vegetarian\u002Fvegan meal, followed by cheese . The fireworks were spectacular and rounded of the evening beautifully. The only downside was ,that my son and his new wife were charged \u00A3250 for the honeymoon suite when they thought it was part of the wedding package. However, when we queried our bill the difference was refunded without fuss.\nThe hotel is lovely and would certainly choose the venue again for future family celebrations.",4,positive

Living abroad as we do, you often take a chance booking something online from a distance with no personal recommendations, but believe me there is no need to to be concerned here because from the moment we pulled up at the front door, we felt special and at home!\nThe front of house staff greeted my husband, myself and my 85 year old parents warmly on arrival and took us straight to the lounge for our cream tea with all the trimmings. The scones were delicious, straight out of the oven, home made strawberry jam, clotted cream and array of teas to choose from was the perfect way to start our visit.\nAfter a quick check in we were escorted to our rooms in the Coach House annex of the hotel. Described as \u2018cosy rooms\u2019 on the web site, we fully expected them to be small but serviceable. They were anything but... \u2018Elm\u2019 and \u2018Magnolia\u2019 were beautiful bedrooms with plenty of light and space.  Decor and bed linens were contemporary in style and luxurious to say the least.\nBathrooms were modern, clean and spacious. But here was our only concern.  Not one room in the hotel has a walk in shower to accommodate older people, something that we really would have liked for my parents.  In the end we decided to take a chance despite this fact and as you may gather we were glad that we did!\nOur two night mid week package included dinner and breakfast each day. The food was delicious on every occasion. Sitting in the lounge with an aperitif and complimentary canap\u00E9s, while making our dinner choice was wonderful. The breakfast buffet was just as tasty as the evening meal, with a great selection of cereals, fruits, juices and pastries and the cooked to order choices all wonderful. \nAll the staff were attentive and accommodating and nothing was too much trouble for them. (A fact that was well noted by my parents.)\nThe Hotel grounds were lovely, and the heated outdoor pool even enticed me to dip my toes in, albeit late September... and I am from The Bahamas, so you know it must have been warm!\nEvery single member of staff that we encountered was professional and friendly. They took the time to enquire how our day had been and indulged in more than just \u2018chit chat\u2019 for the sake of talking. They all seemed to have a caring and committed attitude to making each visitor feel special and pampered.\nThere is no doubt that we will return to the Beechfield again. We would highly recommend it as a choice to others, especially as the management has followed up on our comments, something that rarely, in our experience, happens.\nBeechfield House Hotel is a gem of a place to visit and relax in.

Having our dogs as a main part of our wedding was a huge priority of ours, so we visited a large number of dog friendly wedding venues in the desired area to find the one we felt best suited our requirements - of which there were a large number!!!\nAs well as being the perfect host for us and our dogs, we wanted to find a place that was homely, full of character, child friendly and welcoming - with a mix of formal but friendly atmosphere that would create an elegant but relaxed and inviting wedding day for us and our guests.\nAs soon as we pulled into the drive of Beechfield House we knew we had found 'the one' - no others came close in comparison. The fantastic Jean-Luc showed us around and the more we saw, the more we fell in love. It was like that feeling when you just 'click' and you know you've found exactly what you've been searching for. Everything about it felt perfect and the staff were an excellent mix of friendliness and inviting, whilst maintaining a perfect balance of professionalism and grandeur making you feel special and not 'just another couple getting married' (like some other venues had made us feel).\n\nHaving seen so many venues and having such high hopes I was a bit apprehensive that any venue would live up to our expectations - surely dreams really don't come true?! But my little worries were for nothing, everything we wanted, everything we had planned and discussed was taken on board Gaelle who organised our wedding, and she and the staff at Beechfield set about creating our perfect day, checking and re checking every last plan down to the minute detail to make sure our day went exactly as we had wished for.\n\nAnd what a wonderful day we had!!!!! Gaelle, Corinne and all the staff at Beechfield pulled out all the stops and were on hand every second of the day making sure our day ran smoothly. As any bride and groom would tell you, your wedding day goes by in a flash and I don't know what I would have done without Gaelle and her team. I was so swept away by it all and loving every second that I had no sense of time or any idea of the order of proceedings but Gaelle was there gently overseeing us and making sure we didn't miss a thing and that everything went the way we wanted.\n\nI will always remember arriving at the venue a nervous wreck, with all the guests waiting for my grand entrance in the ceremony room and feeling like a small fish in a big pond, and there was Gaelle smiling waiting to greet me and telling me everything was in hand and that I had nothing to worry about - those few words meant the world and put me at ease to enjoy our big day. \n\nGaelle we can't thank you enough. You are an amazing individual, amazing at your job and we are so grateful we had you on hand to support us through one of the biggest days of our lives. Along with Corinne you made our day amazing, with memories that will last a lifetime. Thank you.\n\nTo all the staff at Beechfield thank you so much for everything you did, we will be back for visits for many years to come.\n\nAnd to Beechfield itself, what a beautiful venue, an incredible setting, and with staff that do you justice.\n\nA million thank you's for our wedding and making our dreams come true xx\n\nCamille and Nick Hoare\n23rd January 2016 \n\n",5,positive

Service is good, with friendly and efficient staff.\nI wouldn't hesitate to revisit this place as we really had an enjoyable stay.\n\nAs to the history, Beechfield was originally built in1878 for a local gentleman farmer and it remained a Victorian family home for 90 years. In 1890 it was bought by the Blake family who owned a Brewery in Trowbridge.\nAfter it was advertised in the 'Country House' a century later, it was bought by two local businessmen who planned to turn it into a top hotel. It was then transformed, keeping the concept of a luxury country house. The coach house was converted in the 1980's and a new restaurant was opened.\nThe current owners purchased the property in 2006, where refurbishment and improvements have been made.\n\nLacock Abbey, owned by the National Trust is also nearby and well worth a visit. The Abbey being used for 'Harry Potter' filming, as well as other well known films using Lacock village. \nCorsham, also not far away, has been used for the more recent Poldark filming.\n\nSo, don't lose the opportunity of these interesting places if in the area, especially with Beachfield House Hotel as an ideal place to stay!",5,positive

This has to set expectations of 'luxury' at a reasonable level.  \n\nWe really enjoyed our stay, we were very happy with the facilities and friendly staff. We particularly liked our spacious room, the comfortable bed, and the open fires in the reception areas.  We felt it offered good value for money.   If you pay significantly more, then it would be fair to expect the furniture and decor to be newer and\u002For more sumptuous, and staff\u002Fservice to be slicker.  \n\nThe food was good, but I do think the prices for the main courses were on the high side.

After looking at many properties on the Internet fortunately we chose Beechfield House.  I had requested a specific room after looking at various photos.  Upon arrival, I realized that my choice was on the top floor of the hotel.  Since I have some problems with my knee we realized this would not be desirable.  Without hesitation, and without asking, we were upgraded to a more accessible room complete with a balcony.  Without exception , the staff were congenial and welcoming.\nThe setting is truly idyllic.....a sparkling pool, lovely patio with a fountain where we had lunch.  Although it was after the designated hours for lunch we were told that it would be \""no problem for the chef to prepare something for us\"" !  We felt as if we were visiting friends in their beautiful country house.  Dinner at the hotel lived up to the expectations of the day !  \nSadly, when we returned to London, we realized that we had left jewelry in the safe.  We called and spoke with Sheradan, a most charming gentleman , who assured us that the jewelry would be kept in the hotel safe until we retrieved it.

I also like the nice spaces around the hotel to sit and read or ponder. Very good.\n\nThe bads were:\n*pretty poor service at breakfast - had to ask for coffee and hot milk 3 times before it arrived. General quality of service not great - it's sort of acceptable but miles from being where it should be in my opinion\n*food quality (breakfast buffet was reasonable but not great, hot food was overcooked, burnt sausages and black pudding, and the full English not particularly satisfying). I personally would not go there for a meal as a result \n*ordered a newspaper for the morning which never arrived\n*worst thing for me though was the awful banging of doors from before 7am this morning (a Saturday) which woke us up and made me feel cross. HATE hotel rooms like this! Such a shame with an otherwise comfortable bed and room. We stayed in \""the Pines\"" in the main house (family room), which seems to be above the kitchen area of the restaurant (on the floor below). That may have been part of it. I also caught staff coming and going through the fire exit door at the end of the corridor\u002Fnext to our room which didn't help (I shut it firmly when I noticed that!). And then the front door to the hotel itself seemed to frequently bang loudly as people came and went and this shuddered through the hotel. I don't want to be disturbed when I'm staying at a hotel and certainly not like this on a weekend morning. It's an otherwise great hotel. But I wouldn't want to attempt sleeping in the main house again.\n\nDespite this we still enjoyed our short one night stay. Big question would be would we go back.

Some bathroom fittings were chipped and looking a bit worn. We personally found the bed quite uncomfortable and not being used to feather bedding it was also very noisy, loud rustling whenever we moved. In the morning I did enquire at reception about changing the bedding and the young lady said they did have other pillows and would find out about a different duvet and have them changed. On arriving back in the evening the bed had been made but nothing changed. For the price I paid, \u00A3485 for two nights, I would expect more than this. We paid a premium for the 'special treatment' and attention that other, more reasonably priced hotels don't offer but I didn't feel we received it.

We were really looking forward to it but left feeling really let down. We were in one of the Cosy rooms in the coach house which was fine, we had left it late to book so all the rooms in the main building were already gone. The room itself was nice. We checked in early afternoon on Christmas Eve and thought we would start our festivities and have a drink, as soon as we sat in one of the lounges we could feel that there was no atmosphere in the hotel. Christmas Eve dinner was of a good standard but we both felt hungry as portions were so small. We were sat in the smaller dining room and this was again silent with a dead atmosphere where the whole room could hear everyone's conversation. Christmas Day morning we were greeted by a waitress who clearly did not want to be there and didn't even wish us a Merry Christmas. Christmas Day lunch was OK, we both had plenty of food and service was good. Christmas Eve buffet was the biggest disappointment, it was terrible. It was like the chef had prepared a few bits, left them out just after lunchtime and gone home. I get it that no one wants to work Christmas Day but to leave just two waiters to deal with everyone and one of them couldn't even speak English!! If you book to go away for Christmas you expect full service all day and evening. The buffet was a few dried up sandwiches, cheese without the biscuits, a salmon and a few other bits. I think the hotel needs to consider how much people have paid for this Christmas Break and guests should have had better service on Christmas Day in the evening. We were left with no choice but to go back to our room and watch TV, we had already done that all afternoon. It was our first time we have been away for Christmas, it was not what we thought it would be and we certainly wont be doing it again! I have contacted the hotel and fed back my concerns, we did get an apology and an explanation of the costs of the Christmas Break as I could not understand why it was so costly when there were no extras and it only included one drink.

We followed this with delicate cured salmon and then a main course of pink lamb medallions, tender as a cloud, served with two-colour carrots, beets and fresh pea shoots.  We then had a fabulous amuse bouche of cucumber granite topped with a frozen gin sorbet and juniper crisp, then to finish, an oblong trio of creamy rhubarb, panacotta and raspberry cream, topped with a cherry tuile.

The manor house is lovely and in idyllic settings- grounds well looked after and sufficient parking area for all guests. The trees were turning all beautiful autumnal colours and it was just picture perfect with the neat garden. Inside, the areas downstairs were full of country manor charm, with cosy seating areas, warm lighting and the fires were lit as well making it very welcoming in the biting chill of November. \n\nThe staff were friendly and helpful, with a special mention to the lady at reception who was an absolute star. She took us up to our room which felt a lot more personal than a lot of other hotels where they just give you the key and send you on your way. Nothing was too much trouble, and it felt like she genuinely cared rather than just box ticking. \n\nThe room itself was lovely. I could have stayed there for a lot longer! We stayed in the classic room and the d\u00E9cor I would describe as modern classic, stylish but not minimalistic, and well decorated in keeping with the style of the hotel. As well as the usual facilities ie. tv, tea and coffee, I loved the extra touches- the Roberts radio, the fluffy gowns, the retro phone which all made the room a bit more special and luxurious. The beds were very comfortable- nice and supportive without being too hard. The white linens were very luxurious. They offer a free turn down service as well. \n\nThe bathroom was clean and again the d\u00E9cor was modern without being too stark. The shower had sufficient pressure for hair washing and there is a proper hairdryer as well (not like those useless ones you sometimes get in hotels). Water very quick to warm up. \n\nWe had breakfast brought up to us and the quality of the food was very good. Decent sausages, great selection of food and options. The little pots of yoghurt were lovely. \n\nOverall I was very impressed with our stay and thought it was great value. I have stayed at 5 star hotels where I haven't received a fraction of the service from here. I think Beechfield House deserves to add a fifth star to its name. It is not easy to find a country manor which has been restored to such lovely, modern standards at such great value and with such superb service as well. It manages to strike the perfect balance between providing a luxury country manor experience without being stuffy and pretentious. \n\nWe felt so welcome during our stay. We will certainly be back.

I booked the hotel direct as I wanted to have the gourmet package. By booking these as a package direct you can save money.  We arrived at 2pm and were very warmly greeted. There was a real personal touch. We were showed to an excellent room with a great view of the garden and pool. The Sycamore room was large spacious with emperor size 4 poster bed and settee. We had champagne and chocolates ready for us on arrival. We really felt at home in the room and could easily stay in the room without venturing out, as it felt so homely.  Then off we went to one of the lovely drawing rooms and we had afternoon tea in front of an open fire. Home made cakes, scones and fab sandwiches.  Later we had the chef's 5 course taster menu. I must say that the salmon course was devine and I'm still savouring it now as I write this. We ended the dinning experience drinking malt by the fire in the bar. Outside the hotel has a great walled garden and some parkland to walk the dog. A great hotel for dogs and families you can see they all love staying there. The bed was so comfortable ideal for a lovely nights sleep.  A nice freshly cooked breakfast and then we were off to see Laycock and its Abbey. We are going to be going back again there soon.

We were told to phone them on the day, which we did and it all worked out perfectly. \n\nReception were really friendly and helpful. One lady showed us to our room and offered help with our luggage, not that we needed it. Our first floor room \u201CMagnolia\u201D was lovely, a good size, comfy bed and very peaceful. The only issue we had was getting the bathroom light and extractor fan (quite noisy) to go off in the early hours. We were told they would turn off on their own but after nearly half an hour I just took the key out of the electric slot and that did the trick. Note for management; I think this needs sorting. \n\nThe grounds are beautifully kept and the hotel building has a plush stately home feel to it. But you\u2019d expect that for \u00A3157 for the night. Although this did include breakfast. There was also an outside heated swimming pool which would be fantastic in decent weather.\n\nBreakfast was one area that could definitely be improved. Everyone was friendly enough, just not particularly efficient or in any rush. I asked for a jug of water three times and after half an hour it eventually turned up. Which would\u2019ve been fine if I was drinking anything else but I wasn\u2019t because of medical reasons. I mean really, how hard can that be? \n\nBreakfast service really was so slow even though it wasn\u2019t busy at all, not great when you\u2019ve got a train to catch. This was comfortably the slowest breakfast service we\u2019ve had anywhere. And we travel a lot. Although there was plenty of toast I thought the portions were pretty stingy if I\u2019m honest. \n\nI also found it a bit odd there wasn\u2019t a 24 hour reception. Instead there was night porter if you come back late. Our key got us in a separate entrance so luckily we didn\u2019t have to phone him. \n\nWe travelled down from London by train and although we were told Melksham is the nearest station there are hardly any trains stopping there. So we went to Chippenham instead, this was roughly a 15 min (\u00A320) taxi journey, so not too bad. \n\nOverall a great stay, in a very nice hotel. Breakfast aside, service here is fantastic! We were sat waiting for someone in the little lounge and in those 10 mins there three different friendly staff members asked us if we were ok and needed anything.

We phoned down and were told that someone would sort it out while we had dinner .\nThis unfortunately didn\u2019t happen and despite 2 visits from staff and 3 further phone calls nothing was done about it the whole weekend resulting in 2 terrible nights sleep even with the windows wide open !\nThe 2 large radiators are right next to the bed and there was no way of regulating the temp at all when we asked to speak to the manager we were told he wouldn\u2019t be in all day and that the supervisor wouldn\u2019t be in till lunchtime so we had breakfast at 8am (on a Sunday morning) and checked out immediately, sad as we had hoped to spend the morning relaxing at the hotel but our room was so uncomfortable we left .\nHaving been told the owners would be in touch and haven\u2019t I can only assume they don\u2019t care but it\u2019s such a shame because I could never recommend this hotel now and it could be such a gem .",3,negative

The room was indeed very cozy, had a nice warm feeling to it.  The view is not very special, to a parking lot but with some trees and greenery.\nThe Room itself was well equipped.  The bed big and comfortable.\nThe bathroom very clean, shower worked well with plenty of warm water. If I would have to point out some negatives, some channels did not come out good on the tv.  A few were out in the ceiling which looks untidy.  The bathroom lighting by the big mirror was totally inadequate.  Impossible for me to apply make up or to shave as my husband pointed out. I used the bedroom mirror  but hope something would get done about that.\nThe staff were  helpful and polite, although the morning we checked out,  the girl who came on morning duty at 7.15am and met me wanting to check out  early because our taxi was coming in a few minutes, was not the most professional or polite for that matter.  She found the bill, we paid but a little note on that.  Laura,  who had booked our taxi should have either informed her or left a note that we are going to be checking out early.  When I said, I would like to pay she said, hold on a minute, I just came in and I have to print out something.  Excuse me?!!!!! Whatever happened to \""customer comes first\""?!! We got none of\"" was your stay nice, please come again\"" or anything along those lines.  Disappointing especially when the same girl on Friday had been smiley and more than helpful when we were checking in. Maybe a bad morning but I am not really interested, it is your job!\nBUT the hotel is beautiful! It is clean and tidy. We had the most wonderful lunch on Friday and such courteous service. \nThe pool is immaculate and heated. Surroundings in excellent shape. \nI would definitely visit again. I think I was missing the feeling that someone is in charge.  People just seemed like workers.  Also I prefer when the staff has name tags so one can direct a question more personally or then at least staff should introduce themselves to the guests.\nThe bar is nice but a bit cold in the atmosphere.  Warm draperies would make a world of different because the small dining room we had lunch in was just beautiful with a warm wall paper and beautiful drapery.\nThe breakfast was superb and the room we had it in so glamorous, just what I would expect at a beautiful old house.\nAll in all a wonderful visit!\n",4,positive

The menu didn't change during our 6 night stay but you could mix and match from the bar menu if you got fed up with the a la carte. The food was excellent and the staff most attentive and friendly. We can recommend the lamb, chicken and hake main courses in particular. Breakfast was a buffet with hot options, the kippers and haddock were particularly good and the chef serves a mean poached egg. The bread is baked in the hotel and simply superb.\nHousekeeping was excellent, biscuits, milk, tea etc and toiletries replaced every day and everywhere was spotless.

The hotel is just off the A350 so is convenient for visiting local National Trust attractions etc. The hotel is an attractive building, surrounded by parkland.  We were shown to our \u2018comfy bedroom\u2019 which was spacious, well decorated and had tea and coffee making facilities.  The bathroom was modern and the towels were of a very good quality.  The view from the bedroom overlooked the gardens and swimming pool. \n\nThe food served at breakfast was a help-yourself area for cereals and juices etc., with the waiter coming over to your table to take your order for cooked breakfast. Unfortunately, on the first night of our evening meal we went into the bar area, to have a pre-dinner drink. We ordered our drinks and sat down.  It took a very long time for anyone to come to us to ask what our choices for dinner would be.  And then we waited a considerable time before we were shown to our table.  We had ordered a bottle of wine but when the waitress came she didn\u2019t bother asking us if we\u2019d like to try it she just poured it into the glasses! The service really was very slow and although there were apologies for the delay we felt it seemed as if there was no-one actually in charge that evening. However, as the song goes \u201Cwhat a difference a day makes.\u201D   We were somewhat apprehensive as to how long it would take to be served the second evening. However, the service was impeccable and the food was far superior.

Check in went smoothly, nice friendly reception staff. We stayed in one of the basic double rooms in the main house and I was surprised by how nice it was. Lovely and spacious, well decorated, fabulously comfy bed, quiet and felt quite luxurious. \nWe had pre dinner drinks in the bar at the front of the hotel whilst choosing from the Al la Carte menu for dinner. The bar is decorated nicely but the seating and tables look cheap and not at all cosy and inviting hence the atmosphere is rather cold. We were shown to our table in the main restaurant, passing by lovely little private dining rooms which looked very inviting. It\u2019s a shame the main restaurant hasn\u2019t the same atmosphere. Again, it needs a makeover to bring a bit of warmth and atmosphere to the room. I asked the waiter if there was any music to mask the deathly silence in the room and he assured us the music was playing and pointed to two little speakers at the far end. Obviously their sound system needs a makeover too!  Our starters and main courses arrived promptly and were pleasant enough but the portion sizes were so tiny it reminded me of \u201Cnouveau cuisine\u201D days from the eighties! Ridiculously small and not worth the money charged. Dessert however was much better.  \nAfter a good night\u2019s sleep breakfast was served in the same room and staff were thin on the ground. My husband asked for porridge followed by a full English breakfast. The porridge never materialised and after a very long wait the full English arrived so we gave up on the porridge. On check out there was no one at the desk so after ringing the bell three times, I found my bill after sifting through the bills left on the desk top until eventually someone turned up. \nSo, I loved certain aspects of this hotel but other areas let it down. Would I stay here again? Yes if it was in the summer to use the lovely pool and grounds but I would eat elsewhere. Otherwise I think not.",3,negative

After a quick check on TA I realised that this is the place to stay. It is a 30 min drive to Bath town centre so a perfect distance for a quiet idyllic retreat.

I do recommend the afternoon tea which is very delicious and we did enjoy this outside. The staff are very friendly and attentive. I organised a private dinner at the hotel and the planning and attention to detail was second to none.

The therapist wasn't organised, couldn't find equipment or glasses and therefore a lot slower than my friends. Therefore, ran out of time to finish my treatment. My friend had a lovely massage after and mine was messy round my toes, nails missing some gell and the therapist told me she put it on too thick and had to repeat the drying process, making toes look like I haven't taken my polish off for a few years. When the therapist was waiting for her glasses to be brought to the treatment room, I asked her if she would mind exfoliating a touch harder - she was that light it tickled but she made me feel like I was being quite difficult. I could see my friends therapist putting a bit of welly into it. I was also in a very awkward stress position the way I was sat which I think was quite obvious; I felt awkward to say anything after the exfoliating comment so just held onto my knees to stay in that position. Very disappointed that at the end when my friends therapist stopped her treatment, mine said 'oops have I run out of time' and just quickly slapped some oil on and kind of rushed us out the door. Having said how much of a poor treatment I was provided, the therapist was friendly enough but just made it clear she was in a hurry, unorganised, didn't pay attention to detail and ignored any personal requests. Had my treatment be half the price, I would probably be happy but at the price you pay, you expect a good standard. If you want a good pedicure, go to the nail bars in the high street.",2,negative

We were told it would be, but when we turned up at the Brassiere they told us that they couldn't serve the four of us as there was a rowdy party of golfers there and it wouldn't be pleasant. So we went to the Lansdowne arms, only to return later to find said rowdy party had moved into the whole bar\u002Flibrary area so that for other guests this would be rowdy too, then in the morning we had to share the Shelbourne for breakfast, where they were still a bit colourful.  If we couldn't eat at the brassiere due to them how come it's ok for us to have a night cap or eat breakfast with them?  If you have rowdy party's perhaps they should be kept in the golf area so other guests aren't inconvenienced.\nAlso we again checked the brassiere would be open for Tuesday evening which the reception assured us it would, only to turn up later that evening to be told again they had closed it.  Whilst we understand that there is less demand at times so it's not always available. It would have been better if the reception had brought to our attention that the brassiere was subject to changes, so did we want to book? Or that they might close early if the felt there was no demand.  All this left us feeling that, though Bowood is delightful place, it is run rather more for the convenience of the kitchen than for the delight of your guests and that any flexibility or relaxed atmosphere is ruined.

11.43\ca\528764\1462736\546793123.html,"Bowood Hotel, Spa and Golf Resort","""The hotel is lovely, a beautiful driveway and stunning house with views of deer. Parking here is easy.\n\nOur group booking was in the wrong spelt name despite being corrected twice on the phone before our trip.\n\nFrom the very start we had issues with the spa because we arrived at midday and were told that we needed our robes, slippers and towels from our rooms (which were not ready until 3pm) to use the spa. The spa staff had to telephone the hotel reception to get another member of staff to collect these items from our rooms. Why the spa were not able to give these out I don't know.\n\nThe spa changing rooms are tiny...really tiny...you are literally trying to get dressed\u002Fundressed while bumping into someone else. If it wasn't a changing room I would have taken a photo because it was laughable.\n\nThe spa itself is also really small. There is also too many people using it vs the space and beds provided. There is very little space to relax and read etc. People reserve the beds with their towels while they use the sauna, steam room, jacuzzi etc. Those spa areas are also really small. The upside is that you have a view of the golf course where we were lucky enough to watch a herd of deer graze. Be warned that golfers can see through the spa glass!\n\nThe treatments were fairly good - not ground breaking and some of our group had really disappointing ones, e.g. being stroked with oil when they booked a massage. Most of the treatments were held in the tower room which was lovely but when you are trying to relax and are halfway through your treatment be warned that there will be a crash of someone emptying glass bottles in to the recycling. This happened during several of our treatments and is extremely loud!\n\nThe cafe service in the spa is slower than slow. Our coffees did not arrive before our food so we cancelled some as we would have liked to enjoy them before we ate. The soup arrived without break and a girl from our party had to go up and get it instead. The chicken Cesar salad came out without the chicken. The recipient asked for no anchovies but when they took the first one back (the one without the chicken) the new one arrived with chicken and anchovies that she didn't want. We were given a free glass of processo for each of our party but I expected much better service.\n\nDinner was included in our package and the quality would have been fine if we were dining at a Jamie's Italian but not at Bowood. It was a set menu. I chose the hummus which arrived in a jar with a few slices of flatbread. No cooking or anything too strenuous involved in that starter! Main was ragu....it was dry and overcooked. Dessert was good - sticky toffee pudding. My party had arranged for a birthday surprise dessert (sparkler and personalised plate with chocolate birthday message) in a sticky toffee pudding. Sadly this arrived by the first sticky toffee pudding i ordered so it was wasted.\n\nOvernight the hotel bedrooms were extremely hot and we experienced a constant buzzing. There are no instructions in the room for the air conditioning. \n\nBreakfast was again slow, with not enough staff. We had to ask for everything...for our order to be taken, for tea\u002Fcoffee, for the toast that was on the menu and should have arrived with the salmon and eggs! One of our party had to send an undercooked omelette back.\n\nWe complained during check out but got the distinct impression that this happens all the time. They apologised and gave us money off our bill but i was not given the impression that any of this would be corrected. A couple checking out next to us was also complaining about breakfast.\n\nI expected so much more from this venue and if it wasn't for the fabulous company the weekend would have been a complete disappointment.",3,negative

However, this time we were incredibly disappointed to see that the Shelburne Reataurant has changed its menu without making this clear to clients. The standard has dropped significantly since our last visit a year ago. What was once a highly sophisticated and select menu has turned into more of a posh \u2018pub grub\u2019 menu with a noticeable drop in the quality of the food. Had we had known this, we\u2019d have sooner dined at the Landsdown pub by the entrance to the grounds for a considerably cheaper price and higher quality. We were also thoroughly disappointed to see the buffet breakfast no longer exists. This is something we overheard several guests discussing at breakfast. We also felt little \u2018extra touches\u2019 as small as providing orange and apple juices in individual bottles has been done away with. The noticeable drop in standard of food was very disappointing and we are not sure we would dine at any of the hotel\u2019s restaurants in future if we were to stay again. We were also angry to see that while an obvious drop in the standard of food has taken place, no alterations to the overall price had been made. This is a great shame as we have enjoyed coming to Bowood on many occasions and always look forward to the high quality dining. ",3,negative

All of which are a minimum for the tariff here.\n\nHowever, we found that a good may people who stay here seem to have little or no regard for fellow guests. Early morning and late night, guests come and go from their rooms, much as they would in a youth hostel. Loud and boisterous with much slamming of doors and noisy hilarity in public spaces.\n\nDespite the do not disturb sign clearly hung on our door, housekeeping deployed their best foghorn voices whilst cleaning, so a lie-in is not an option.\n\nThe outdoor Rattan furniture was littered with bird faeces so not safe\u002Fhygienic to sit on with young children.\n\nAlthough high chairs are available, the head height is level with the table so they are too low for the child to reach the table and present a risk of head injury if the child bends forward. A common problem in many hotels but not one I expected in this standard of venue.\n\nFinally, children are only allowed to use the pool facility for 75 minutes, twice daily. So hardly \u2018family friendly\u2019.\n\nThis establishment has much to offer I\u2019m sure but relaxing sleep or flexible family time\u002Fstandards aren\u2019t amongst them so would recommend elsewhere if those are important. This hotel would do better to eschew it\u2019s \u2018family friendly\u2019 marketing and be straight about what it is - an adult getaway venue for a good time.\n\n",2,negative

We had the same suite as last time - Nairne Suite (227) - which is a beautiful room with an excellent bathroom. Everywhere is kept spotlessly clean and fresh.  We were given a bottle of fizz to celebrate our birthdays which was a nice touch and you get fresh cookies every day too.\nOur only negative comments this time would be about dining!  The cooked breakfast menu is excellent and the food good.  On the cold buffet the bread is very disappointing.  There's only white or brown sliced bread for toast.  There's no specialist seeded bread or baguettes and no cheese or cold meats as an alternative to a cooked breakfast.  The yogurts in the glass jars are delicious though!   The dinner arrangement has changed and there is now a menu for those on a dinner,bed and breakfast tariff.  There is an allowance of \u00A325 if you want to chose from the main menu.  The short menu is quite restricting for a four day stay so we ate off the main menu most of the time.  The food is excellent but we were extremely disappointed on two nights to be told there was no smoked salmon! How does a hotel run out of smoked salmon!! \nI had a massage in the spa and my husband used the gym.  Both were very good.

It was chopped up mango and fish with no tigers milk to fuse the flavours. We've made much better at home. \nMy Korean chicken tasted good although no points for authenticity, however my husband's steak was inedible.

Fundamentally there is nothing wrong with the hotel and the facilities but Bowood just isn't what it used to be. \n\nAs always the staff are friendly and the majority will go out of their way to help you. We did on this occasion encounter some of the 'suits' and they weren't particularly welcoming. One of them a younger gentleman, probably early 20's with black hair, was strutting around as if he owned the place and almost seemed to have the attitude that he was doing the guests a favour by being there. We did find out later that he was the Food and Beverage Manager. Maybe he should focus on some of the food and drinks offering at the hotel.\n\nThe food in the Restaurant was ok but the restaurant style has been changed and the menu is uninspiring and not what we are used to from Bowood. The food in the restaurant needs to be different from what is being served elsewhere but it all just feels like it has been put together by a Chef who seems to be more worried about his bottom line than the actual quality of the food.\n\nThe drinks in the bar are reasonably priced with a great selection of spirits however it doesn't help having a great selection if the person serving it doesn't know how to actually serve them.\n\nThe wine list has changed completely, probably a supplier change by the looks of it, and the list is now feels like any other list you could find in any other hotel with prices that don't necessarily match the quality.\n\nThe golf course, as always, is in fantastic condition and is always a challenge particularly for those of us that aren't that great at golf. The Spa facilities were busy but it was well managed by the staff on duty and my wife enjoyed her treatments.\n\nSo all in all an ok stay but we probably won't be back.",3,negative

The rooms and facilities are still of excellent quality with perhaps the best showers I've ever experienced.  Sadly, on our last visit the food in the Shelbourne restaurant had deteriorated significantly and this put a huge dampener on the experience since in the past it had always been something to really look forward to.  For example, my wife ordered what was described on the menu as bream ceviche and was in fact cooked, nondescript very \""fishy\"" white fish on a very tired looking bed of salad rather than a nice piece of bream cured in citrus juice.  We complained and were told that this was \""chef's take on a ceviche\"".  It wasn't ceviche so it shouldn't have been described as such!  That said, we were refunded the cost of the dish and given a couple of free drinks but this doesn't detract from the fact that the food was generally poor.  Of the six dishes ordered only the deserts were anywhere near the standards that the restaurant previously achieved.  \n\nUnless the issues with the food are addressed, sadly I think this will be our last visit.",4,positive

The actual Hotel frontage does not state Bowood Hotel and you are left wondering if in fact you've come to the back entrance?  There was no meet and greet - We went inside to check we were in the correct place.  The rooms are strictly not ready until 3pm, so if you intend arriving earlier, that's great as long as you've packed well, with swimwear on top of case to go to spa area, or walking shoes etc for a complimentary visit to Bowood House and Gardens.

The price of a standard glass of wine was \u00A35 a time, something to watch out for.... maybe a bottle was better priced than 2 glasses at \u00A310.

With the exception of the bar and restaurant staff not quieting a rowdy group in the dining room, our overall experience was very good.My room (#221), had a tub and a separate shower. My wife and I are not bathers, but my wife took a soaking bath after we checked in which told me she felt the bath tub was exceptionally clean.While she bathed, I went for a 3 mile run and it was easy to do without leaving the grounds (although some of it was on unpaved footpaths and I had to be extremely aware of foot placement so I wouldn't sprain an ankle).The shower had great water pressure and plenty of hot water.

We asked the hotel if they could make the bed \""American\"" style with a top sheet and blanket and it was made that way when we arrived. The sheets are very soft with a high thread count.The air conditioner was very quiet and cooled the room nicely.The rooms are well appointed but have limited storage. The bathroom would benefit by having more shelf space and it would help if the bedside tables had some drawers or a shelf.There are some scuff marks here and there and perhaps the rooms and hallways could be a tad bit cleaner and better maintained, but in all fairness we stayed at the end of their high season and I imagine that the entire hotel will be spruced up a bit in their off season.They have a very nice vegan menu and Chef Alex did a great job of a creating something for us without onions and garlic on short notice.

We arrived early afternoon and were shown straight to our room on the ground floor overlooking the golf course. At various times of the day there were fallow deer grazing on the golf course and wandering in the wooded areas. Great to watch. \nThe room was lovely with a decent sized bathroom, complimentary toiletries and a robe & slippers each of us for use in the spa\u002Fpool. Plenty of storage space & tea\u002Fcoffee facilities. Freshly home made cookies in a tin as a welcome. \n\nThe bar area is spacious and the bar itself well stocked. Plenty of seating areas and a lovely library area with an open fire. Quite a good sized restaurant with an excellent menu. \nThe area around Bowood is beautiful although the house and gardens were closed for the winter unfortunately.

Plenty of choices of treatments.There\u2019s a well equipped gym and pool area with lots of seating.

A costly exercise for a place of this size. The plus side for me is that the public areas where comfortable and I liked the feel of the place. My biggest dread with regard to furnishings is if someone renovated the place and made it sterile it would be a shame.

Ok, so no flat screen TV but there was a TV and the room appeared to be clean with good bead linen. The view to the courtyard is not the prettiest view but I did find it interesting with old buildings and a blossoming tree.

I loved all the old photographs, I loved the history. The bed may have been a tad lumpy, TV channels are limited but I chose this place because of price and was not disappointed.

The room I had was beautiful I would say four star and I have been to many hotels.  The hotel has a nice laid back feeling more like being at home than a hotel.  A real log fire to sit at when having a drink or snack.  They have also refurbished the dining room which is lovely only one gripe here they need to put more cups out and also hot water for the earl grey tea.  I had something to eat in the evening from the main menu and it was superb and the creme brulee was to die for.  \nThe furniture in the room was spot on although it would have been nice to have some place mats on the bedside tables for cups.

There is surely no need for music in public rooms to be played at such a high decibel count.  A repeated complaint the next morning was met by our being moved to a newly refurbished room on the front of the hotel.  This room was bright, imaginatively decorated and appoointed; the traffic noise from the main street outside was not obtrusive at all.

I went in and all of the lamp shades were wonky ( one even had a burn mark on it) the curtains were hanging off and for some reason the bed was screwed to the wall?!!!!! Needless to say I walked round and straightened it all up. Second room- this was ok but the water for the bath ran soooo slowly that it was pretty much cold when you got into it .third room- had a pungent smell off egg!!! Gross, nearly unbearable . All three rooms were stupidly dated and needed a huge update. Room one smelt badly of cigarette smoke in the bathroom. Also a room was booked for my return specifically as i have problems with stairs, I double checked and was told this was definitely ok, only to be shifted round all the way into the attic pretty much ( third room) with a rather unhelpful member of staff just replying with \"" it's not my fault , I didn't change it and I can't give you another room either. I'll have a talk with the girl who changed it!!\"" No proper apology, no offer of a compensation of any kind and more annoyingly its an I don't really care attitude from the staff. Also the whole place is seriously understaffed. You have to go and get someone from the bar yourself if you want to check in at reception, there's just no one about! Don't be fooled by the photo that they've put up advertising the rooms. Yes they have refurbished some rooms and they do look nice but for some reason they are saving these for a rainy day, they'd rather put you in one of their gross rooms and leave the nice ones empty. Even if you're like me walking up billions of stairs, even when I clearly stated I couldn't to staff, they left the newly refurbished ones empty and wouldn't move me.Stupid really because they could avoid this kind of feedback if they closed the old horrible rooms entirely and just gave people the new ones,. Even if they've paid for a basic room what's the harm in upgrading someone?! Especially to help your bad reputation! .also they took the entire amount for the whole length of my stay on the day I booked ( this was months before I even got there) so there was no point in trying to get any money back. I potentially could have lost my money , had no where to stay and would've had to pay for somewhere else too.good luck finding someone so you can complain and even if you do then you'll probably receive an I don't care attitude.

I would rate The Lansdowne 0-1.

When I looked up the reviews on Trip Adviser I was worried that the hotel would be terrible.\nHowever We arrived and managed to park without difficulty. We walked into the reception area and as previously noted there was a notice saying that the barman doubled up as receptionist. The bar was right next door to reception with no door and immediately I put my head into the bar a charming young lady came out and did her reception duties. She gave us instructions for getting to the room and off we went. The stairs are ancient as is the hotel and need renovating. The hotel is being renovated bit by bit.\nOur room 216 was at the end of a corridor and was very clean. The windows had been shut and so there was a faint musty smell but it disappeared within minutes once we opened the window.\nThe bathroom was very clean. The shower\u002Fbath worked perfectly and there was always plenty of hot water.\nThe, hotel is in the middle of Caln so we immediately took a walk round the town centre. It is a small place but has excellent supermarkets in Sainsburys, the Co-op supermarket, Iceland and other stores in a new, very near area. Harris' bacon factory was in the middle of town and was demolished when the company went bankrupt so leaving a large central area for new shops and a library.\nWe were booked in for half-board on our rambling holiday and feared the worst when we went to the dining room for dinner. WRONG\u003E The food was delicious. All five nights the food was really good. It was presented as it would be in most homes, nothing over fancy but very well cooked and plenty of it. On two nights there was so much that I couldn't finish the meal in spite of loving the taste. We had three courses and each course had three options so we were spoilt for choice. The two vegetarians in our group were happy with their options. The service was fast and polite. The food was always hot -on occasions too hot. We had no complaints - just the opposite we were delighted.\nThe buffet breakfast was served from 7.00 till 9.00 am. There was a choice of four cereals but you could have oats if you asked for them as my wife did. Two juices and a hot array of bacon, egg, sausage, beans, fried bread and fried tomatoes. There was no shortage and help was at hand if you needed it.\nWe slept very well. Though the hotel is at the side of the busy A4 we heard nothing. The beds were rather old but perfectly comfortable.\nOn Tuesday evening England were playing an international football match. In a room adjacent to the bar the hotel staff lowered a giant sized screen and several members of our group joined locals to see the match. The room is not attached to the bar and so local people and anyone else could drink in peace. The hotel run a darts team and on Friday played a league match in that same room. There were very many people around but there was no disturbance for our group and our evenings were run as usual.\nThe hotel is a local pub and is quite popular. The beer is brewed by the owners of the hotel Arkelles. The beer is good.\nOn the Monday when we arrived 25 of the 26 rooms were booked so the hotel is reasonably popular. We didn't eat lunch in the hotel and did not test the Sunday lunch that someone complained about.\nWe expected the worst when we read some of the reviews but honestly we were well treated by a friendly, efficient, warm staff who attended to our needs immediately. Though the hotel is several hundred years old and needs the makeover that it is getting I must say that we had a very happy stay there and had no real complaint.

The room could have been cleaner in the corners, behind the doors and in the drawers, but it was clean everywhere else. There is plenty of hot water available and toiletries add a nice touch. There were a couple of lights that did not work but we didn't bother to say anything - it was not that important. There was a kettle and beverages in the bedroom however the bar has some good local beers (Arkells) and it was nice to be able to take a drink back to our room after sitting next to the fire for a while chatting with the archaeologists that are on a prolonged stay at the hotel. Very interesting.\nThe chef is excellent and the food was delicious. The dining room is light and pleasantly decorated. It is warmer to sit away from the door. The serving of breakfast at the weekend differed from during the week. There was a variety of juices and cereal, grapefruit and peaches at the weekend with a self serve hot plate and pump flasks for tea and coffee. Whereas during the week there was help yourself juice and cereal, waiter (or waitress) service for a cooked breakfast, beverages and toast. The staff are lovely.\nThe 2 Steaks and a bottle of wine for \u00A321 was excellent. We agreed that these were the best steaks that we had ever had. The mid week Roast was also very enjoyable and only \u00A35.99 - we both had lamb. \nThe car parking is limited but it is not a problem to park anywhere, as everyone is friendly and usually before going to bed there is a space to move into if you've had to block a car or two. \nThe free wifi is available in the bar and lounge on Cloud and they are hoping to make wifi available in the bedrooms soon. \nTo summarize; comfy bed, excellent food, good value and friendly staff.",4,positive

What did bother us was the lack of heating in the bedrooms.  We asked for heating to be put on but it was explained this was not possible as it is centrally controlled and not due to go on yet.  However, the temperature was only 12 degrees in our rooms and the heating needed to be on as the rooms are very large and the hotel being old is rather chilly as probably the doors had been open all day due to the workmen going in and out.   The receptionist did her best and provided my friend with an extra duvet.  The hotel seems to have maintenance issues in the rooms.  The battery had gone in one of the remotes and surely someone would have pointed this out as they don't go flat all of a sudden.  This was eventually replaced.  The towel rail in the bathroom of 207 was not working, which we reported but nothing was done.  The hotel needs a lot of work done to it as there was for instance a hole in the ceiling of 207.  Decoration looked OK if you did not look too closely at the slipshod manner the wallpapering had been done in 206 - surely not done by professionals.  However, it looked OK - carpets were clean, bedding nice, beds soft.  Breakfast was delicious.

On arriving at the hotel he felt that the receptionist was being funny towards him, as if he didn't like him. Very passive aggressive and sarcastic. My partner did make a joke and maybe he took it the wrong way? Not thinking much of it the receptionist gave them their room keys (they had a room each) and they went to their rooms. All of them, expect my partner had rooms on the newest side of the building however he had a room at the very top of the old side of the hotel that had bars on the window and felt a million miles away from everyone else. He thought this was a bit strange and the room felt eerie but thought it was the fact that he was on his own far away from everyone else. At about 7-8pm he was relaxing in his room and the wardrobe door opened on it own. He investigated it, shut it and stomped around testing to see if it happened maybe by a loose floorboard. Nothing happened. He tried to forget about it but then the bathroom door shut on its own. Not just pushed to, actually closed! There were no windows open or any draft coming in the room so it's unexplainable. It was only until he told me all of this that I looked online and saw a post from a previous employee stating that no one goes into room 242 because strange things always happen. Upon reading it to myself I asked him what his room number was and he said it was 242. I have never heard anything so freaky yet hysterical in my life.

My friends had olives and the soup respectively.\nFor main, I had the sea bream, which was fantastic, and my dinner partners had steak and the vegetarian burger, both had empty plates.\nAt this point we couldn't wait for dessert and chose one each from the menu and tried bits of each.

The newly redesigned interiors are a revelation, excellent lighting and colours, with a fantastically improved bar area.  The dining room is relocated to the other side of the ground floor to where it was and is softened by bookcases dividing much of the space into cosy areas. We had a table for 4 on the Friday evening. We ordered our drinks at the bar and sat in the lounge for a while before walking through. The nice wine glasses and proper linen napkins on the table were appreciated. What let down the show was what apeared to be a lack of organisation. The young serving staff were lovely and charming but when we first got seated we were left for 20 minutes while most of them were in earnest discussion over the bookings desk. Still, the room was soon packed out with diners, creating a nice atmosphere. We had booked as we were attracted by the website stating there was a  Friday fish night (\u00A35.50 for a main) but were told when we were ordering that it  as no longer on offer.

We had a gorgeous Sunday lunch with friends, the food was amazing and we had a lovely time until it took 30 mins to get the bill sorted but we put that down to it being their first weekend of Sunday lunches. Forgivable. \nFinally in Calne somewhere nice to go where we could walk to and offered our fussy 11yr old, a good children's menu that offered something different from the standard Sunday roast.\nSo with high hopes we booked in for lunch today with the mother-in-law,brother and sister in-law and their 2 year old beauty. Once again thoroughly impressed with the setting and staff were very welcoming.\n All was great until it came to ordering when we were told by our waitress that they didn't have a children's menu anymore and that children could have anything off the main menu for half the price.  As amazing as the menu is, it is not very child friendly unless your child likes a roast. I questioned the waitress as to why they didn't have a kid's menu anymore,since a month ago, and our daughter had been looking forward to her burger ( a rare occurrence)   to be told that they had new management who just wanted the one menu. So anyone who has a really (annoying) fussy child will know this was a complete nightmare, resulting in said child refusing any of the options offered! At the end of my tether when it came to ordering I asked if said fussy child could have a bowl of chips with some bread (all offered in various meals on the menu) to be told she would have to check with the chef!?? Really!? I'm not a person who likes confrontation or to be difficult but I'm not asking for much, they have a board outside stating children welcome- why have such a pretentious menu if you're trying to appeal to families?? \nAnyway with the approval of the chef we were allowed our bowl of chips and enjoyed our meals.  Service was extremely slow afterwards, so much so we had to ask to order puddings, which was completely confused- when asked if puddings were done in children's portions and told yes, we were then told they only served ice cream on the children's menu ( what childen menu??) All 3 of our children wanted the sticky toffee puds so we were satisfied with paying full price but left confused again when the waitress finally returned with puddings but wanted to give the adult ones first as she said the children's ones may be following!??!  \n BUT what really got my goat, after finishing our puds,  was watching one of the waitresses come out of the kitchen with believe it or not- a child's burger and chips off the the children's menu that doesn't exist anymore!!!!! Er hello, I'm completely confused?? So much so I had to query how this meal that doesn't exist on any of their menus but did a month ago has suddenly appeared ,even after I'd previously asked for said burger!!? I was told by our waitress that the chef had GIVEN UP and was serving children's menu .Not being funny but WTF???? Make your mind up!!  We've just sat there with our little daughter trying her best to look happy eating a scabby half portion of chips!! That they charged us full price for (\u00A36) until I kicked up a fuss. \n\nWell thank you Lansdowne for deducting off our rather hefty bill one kid's meal, but maybe if we'd had the opportunity to order off your exclusive secret children's menu, our 2 year old niece may have eaten her meal instead of wasting another \u00A36.\n\nPlease can I warn any potential customer to check before hand which menu the chef is cooking from as he or his staff had no idea today- good luck, such a shame as it has such potential!",2,negative

Upon enquiring about why such awful rooms had been allocated to us, we were told that unfortunately the hotel was full and that the newly renovated rooms (of which there are 6) were occupied. We managed to change one room to something which could be described as 2 star, rather than the 1 star we would have awarded the first room.  The other room could not be changed.  This new room had kind of been renovated but the bathroom was really old and tatty with a very dribbly shower.  The windows were painted shut and there was a massive stain on the carpet.  The beds were comfortable enough but the lighting was pathetic.  The soap and shower gel was quite horrid and smelt revolting.  Onto breakfast.  Coffee was weak and when we asked for proper coffee from the machine they use in the bar we were charged extra.  I had porridge - no question of any fruit in the kitchen - and the porridge wasn't cooked properly, the oats just floating in milk.  I left the whole bowl and no-one bothered to ask if there was a problem with it.  Having got served by a totally disinterested waitress, I lost the will to complain further.  When I complained about the huge difference between the photographs on the Booking.com website and the actual rooms we were given I was advised not to use the website again but to book directly with the hotel.\nWe shall not be returning again but would advise anyone who wants to risk staying here to make sure they book one of the renovated rooms - you'll know immediately upon arrival if you are given an unrenovated room as they are rather akin to second rate students digs.",1,negative

There is no doubt that the food and decor are greatly improved since the makeover. We have had some very nice meals with friends and continue to recommend the restaurant.\nHowever, our last visit was for a Sunday lunch which was a bit of a disappointment, especially given the increased price. The Sunday carvery at the Lansdowne in the 'old days' was in fact the only thing we liked about it, 2 courses of good straightforward food for something like \u00A311. Now it is rather more more than that, and no longer a carvery of course, but the irony is that the meal was only average and, we all had to agree, the roast potatoes were overdone and like rocks. We will come again, on a Saturday or during the week, but there are far better Sunday lunches around. The service though is always friendly and efficient, including the bar staff, so I'm still giving quite a high mark overall.",4,positive

Why would you put a family room facing into the court yard where drunks are shouting swearing all night and best of all smoking. We had a 2 year old with us and we could not sleep for the noise and smoke entering the room, we couldn\u2019t close the window as it was the hottest day of the year so far and the room was like a sauna. Calnes finest was out in force in the court yard shouting, screaming and swearing constantly. Best of all when they needed to change the barrel for the pub they had to roll it across a cobbled car park to the cellar, really at 22:30 at night you had to roll those barrels across the yard. When eventually they closed the doors and the finest of Calne left, I got up to go to the toilet looked out the window and one of the regulars was led out on a bench absolutely blotted sleeping, at least someone got some sleep I suppose.

I asked about the cooked breakfast so the waitress said she would have to go get a menu, whilst she had gone to get a menu another couple staying at the hotel shown me their sausages from their cooked breakfast. They were stone cold pink uncooked in the middle. They also mentioned that the beans came in a poxy little pot on the plate that had about 2 beans in it.

I'd read about Castle Combe and as it was only 20 miles away, rang the Castle Combe Inn first (which was fully booked) however they recommended the Manor House and within minutes I was booked in.\n\nFinding my way to the village of Castle Combe was a little confusing, I was tired, having driven across from West Wales. I managed to find the golf club and then followed a sign for the hotel but at the bottom of the road, finding no sign to indicate where the hotel was, I turned left instead of right, driving in totally the wrong direction. Rectifying the mistake 15 minutes later, I eventually found the entrance to the Manor House and drove down the long winding driveway, fringed by gorgeous lawns, to stop outside the stunning manor house which is a listed building.\n\nI was quickly checked in and shown to my room which was a very large attic double (kingsize bed?), beautifully equipped with good quality linen, gowns, slippers, television, bottles of water, tea\u002Fcoffee tray, en suite bathroom (with slightly confusing shower\u002Fmixer tap) with shampoo, conditioner, comb, bath gel, bath hat.  Everything you could possibly need for an overnight stay was provided.  Creaking floorboards and an original panel of wattle and daub added to the natural beauty of the room. \n\nThe only thing wrong with the room was that the TV in the bathroom (yes, bathroom!) wasn't working and although the bedroom had a double aspect, only one set of windows opened which resulted in the room being a little warm and as the other window opened over the front entrance of the house, the Japanese tourists who were chatting outside at 0700 the next door were a delightful alarm clock (not!).   \n\nRoom service was pretty good - pasta with good sized juicy prawns and breakfast the next day was also decent and included in the price: just as well because this place isn't cheap.\n\nThe rest of the hotel is very attractively designed and well planned, with lots of comfortable lounges tucked away and the grounds were equally stunning, wide lawns with hovering birds of prey, a gazebo (presumably for weddings), Italian rococo style garden, massive chicken coop and nearby piggies (unfortunately sheltering from the rain so I never saw them).  \n\nBy the way, all the staff were very helpful, friendly and incredibly efficient.  I couldn't fault one of them.\n\nAs for Castle Combe itself, well, yes it's pretty in a sort of chocolate box Disney-esque idea of Yee olde English village but I'm afraid the heart has been ripped out of it and the coach loads of tourists stopping off there (yes, I know, I'm one of them), totally spoil it.

The carpet was filthy, leaving a gradually disappearing trail of grime across the floor. Furniture and decor also in need of attention. V disappointing for a 5* hotel. Dinner was also distinctly average, as was breakfast. Again disappointing - not planning a return visit in the future.",3,negative

We met in the comfortable bar area with fine views over the lovely well-kept grounds.

We all chose from the daily menu with a choice of two starters, mains and desserts preceded by an excellent small amuse bouche. Between us, we tried both options of starters and mains but we all finished with the excellent raspberry creme br\u00FBl\u00E9e!\nEveryone admired both the presentation and flavours of the dishes we sampled, each served with appropriate professional panache and attention to detail. There is an extensive wine list for the adventurous, but we chose a modest bottle, supplemented by some individual glasses, offerred in a choice of small or medium size. We rounded off our meal with coffee accompanied by excellent hand-made petit fours. With generous service our bill came in at just a shade under \u00A350 a head which we regarded as good value for a most enjoyable experience in an establishment of this quality which we would be pleased to recommend and very happy to return to.",5,positive

The gardens are well worth a visit with lots of quirky follies, well tended lawns, vegetable plots, water features and formal planting.\nOur room was in the main building up a few flights of stone stairs, so it would be difficult for people with mobility problems.

I'd played golf here for years but never stayed in the hotel.  \n\nGood points first:\n1. Exquisite setting and wonderful peace and views\n2. Exceptional standard of furniture \n3. Very comfortable bed\n\nBad Points:\n1. ALL the staff were foreign - Eastern European. Whilst this isn't a major issue normally, it is when you are staying in a place marketed as a quintessential English hotel. Most of the time their English was so poor and their accents so strong that we failed to understand them.  The service was also 'suffocating' - asked far too many times at dinner if all was OK and great lengths were taken to explain (not that we could understand) the dinner. I overheard an affluent American family comment that they couldn\u2019t understand the staff either.\n2.  Speaking of dinner. Michelin Star restaurant. Way overpriced. \u00A366 per head for food where I could have fitted all three courses onto a side plate. The portions wouldn't even sate a sparrow. Plus my wife's dinner was cold, but we were so hungry after restaurant being about an hour behind (due to a large party we were told) that we ate it anyway.  When we complained all we got was a 'sorry' and nothing taken off the bill.  If we book for 2030hrs we expect to be taken through at 2030hrs. Not 2100hrs because your booking admin for large parties is so rubbish?\n3. Whilst the room was furnished well, the so called 'suite' was anything but.  The bath and bee-day were in the right hand side of the room in a central prominent position. Why on earth is a bee-day on open view in the middle of the room? Disgusting.  We used the bath the following morning but had to vacate quickly as a very foul Sulphurous smell was coming from the overflow; it was so bad we had to get out of the room.  It stank.  We'd paid \u00A330 extra for a bath that we couldn't use.  When I complained they knocked off \u00A322 off our bar bill. Geez - thanks. I was also expecting Molton Brown toiletries at least \u2013 not some cheap black and white branded rubbish \u2013 esp for the \u00A3320 for one night.\n4. Speaking of the bar - ridiculous prices. \u00A311 for a glass of wine where I could have got the same bottle for half the price in town.  Why do these establishments rip people off when consuming wine? Exactly what justification is there for charging 3-4 times the actual cost of a bottle of wine? It's just a blatant rip-off.  Cocktails, read spirit and mixer - \u00A315. Some much better high end establishments cost less in central London!!\n\nOverall - very overpriced. Trying to be something it's not. At breakfast some tramp like wedding party guests were dressed in sports-kit that I'd go running in - in the main dining hall. Disgusting.  The only 'exclusive' thing about these 'exclusive' hotel chains is there pricing.  Stop trying to charge inner-city prices for average service and amenities. We should have had more money knocked off for having to vacate room (excuse was heavy rain and drains overflowing- hey \u2013not my problem) and the cold dinner. Staff only offered minor concessions. \n\nBest golf course in country in my view. Just don't stay in the overpriced hotel.  There is an excellent pub for food in the village - I wish we'd have eaten there.",3,negative

The grounds are beautiful and Castle Coombe is a chocolate-box English village. The main hotel interior is very comfortable but a little tired. We booked a \""special feature\"" room, deliberately choosing the expensive option, but should not have bothered: on arrival we were surprised to be sent from the main hotel a short drive to the carpark, near a row of cottages: our room was on the first floor at the back, with no view and overlooked by other rooms. The stone stairs were narrow and there was no lift - this ought to be signalled in the details before booking. We were looking forward to a comfortable stay and one of the attractions had been the reviews saying how nice it was to wander the beautiful manor house at any time of day\u002Fevening. This is impossible if you are stuck in a row of cottages a walk away from the building.  The room was large as specified but did not match the photos: there was no bay window, the d\u00E9cor was old-fashioned but not elegant, and there were no upmarket fabrics. The floor was incredibly creaky and the wooden furniture was mock period but uncomfortable and rather tatty. The hospitality tray was basic and very limited, amazingly so for a luxury hotel. The bathroom did not have the elegant stand-alone baths shown in the pictures - in fact nothing was as shown in the pictures (although there was an in-bathroom TV and a rather cute purple bath duck). Breakfast was another huge disappointment: we stay in many 4 and sometimes 3 star hotels, as well as conference centres: and it is  along time since we have encountered such a limited range at breakfast in any of these, indeed most 3 star hotels can do better than this. When I asked about porridge, the waitress said \""oh yes, we have missed that off the menu\"", but I needn't have bothered here either, as when it arrived after a long delay it was not worth the wait: I could have cooked better myself. Toast was basic and the tea was poor in quality - despite the grand teapot. We had to ask for items to be restocked on the buffet table which was also extremely limited. We were also surprised by the lack of senior staff or management seen over our stay: everyone encountered was young and, although pleasant, not pro-active or well trained. I hit my foot on a wooden chest in the bedroom and when I told the receptionist about this in the morning (it left a very nasty bruise and I was limping!), she merely replied \""Oh\"". We were so disillusioned with the place and anxious to get away that we did not take this any further.

Ours (named Stonehill) was fabulous: a huge 4 post, wood carved bed and a bathroom -  complete with a cast-iron roll top bath - the size of a small ballroom were the most memorable features.\n\nThe house itself is superb. Wood panelling everywhere and high quality decor to match.\n\nEven though the place was extremely busy with weddings, golfers & assorted diners, the staff were excellent. Nothing was too much trouble for them.\n\nOne word of caution: due to its age & heritage listing, there is no lift, so less able-bodied guests may struggle, although the staff were more than willing help with the movement of luggage to\u002Ffrom the rooms.\n\nIs it expensive?

11.43\ca\528765\191624\338164321.html,The Manor House Hotel and Golf Club,"""We visited the Manor House hotel for a two night break over New Year. The main hotel building is truly beautiful, as are the surrounding grounds. When checked in we were advised we were actually staying in one of the cottages just down from the hotel. As mentioned in previous posts, check-in was not particularly thorough, we were not informed of any hotel facilities, including golf or even provided with a briefing of the evening\u2019s events. A young gentleman walked us down to our cottage and showed us about briefly. The cottage was beautiful, we had the ground floor which had a very large bedroom area, another seating area and huge bathroom.\n \nShortly after checking in we went for a short stroll around Castle Combe, which is very picturesque, and visited both of the local pubs, one which is more of a modern eating establishment and the other a more traditional \u2018locals\u2019 pubs \u2013 both very welcoming, however we were unable to eat at either over our two day stay as they were too busy \u2013 booking is certainly advised. As we couldn\u2019t get food at the pub we went back to the hotel and ordered a bar snack, for this was sat in one of the drawing rooms in the hotel, again just beautiful, the furniture, the d\u00E9cor, everything. \nThe New Year\u2019s Eve party itself was fantastic, it started with a champagne reception. We were expecting a single welcome drink, but they kept on filling up our glasses! There were also a range of delicious canap\u00E9s going around.  This was followed by a 5 course dinner in the Michelin Stared Bybrook restaurant, where we sat with other guest, a nice way to get to know each other. The food again was delicious and each course was paired perfectly with a wine. Dinner was followed by a disco and Casino, not being gambling fans we skipped the casino and hit the dance floor. The music was provided by a live band who rolled off some greats hit to suit all ages. I would certainly recommend their New Year\u2019s Eve package, it was a fabulous evening. \n\nWhen we went to bed we noticed that despite having a large double headboard, the bed was actually made up of two single beds pushed together. You could certainly feel the gap between them and we kept rolling into the middle of the bed throughout the night. We didn\u2019t have the best night\u2019s sleep. The following morning we made reception aware of this and they told us they would tell housekeeping to push them closer together\u2026. Needless to say the next night\u2019s sleep wasn\u2019t much better. \nBreakfast, again in the Bybrook Restaurant, was nice. It\u2019s a smallish spread but has everything you need. You order hot breakfast from the menu. Recovering a little from the celebrations the night before we ordered the full English, it looked lovely but it was missing items that were listed on the menu. Unfortunately we were sat in the corner and no one came back to check us so we could raise this as an issue. Another minor issue, when we ordered lunch to our room we ordered a bread basket which was delivered with no butter\u2026 I\u2019m sure it was beautiful bread but all far too dry. \n\nThat evening we had dinner booked again at the Bybrook as part of our NYE package. We thought we would start with a drink in the bar, which has an amazing selection of gins. As a gin lover I asked the bar man to recommend a gin from their large selection, he said abruptly \u2018well what do you want?\u2019, I said something unique, to which he replied \u2018It\u2019s gin, they are all unique\u2019 and walked off\u2026I found it very pretentious and I did not get my gin! Dinner however again was superb and the staff in the restaurant including the sommelier were fantastic, so attentive. Each one took the time to get to know their guests but without being obtrusive. A true asset to the hotel. \n\nI would certainly recommend this hotel, it\u2019s stunning and in a beautiful part of the world. However, there are a few areas which can be improved upon.",4,positive

We were greeted in our room by a bottle of Champagne and some blueberry macaroons--yummy--and had time to rest and relax before dinner. We had an aperitif in the bar, served by a pleasant young man and accompanied by excellent 'nibbles', then we had a superlative meal in the restaurant--not just fabulous food but brilliant and friendly service, with congratulations offered on our anniversary. I am not normally a great fan of desserts, but this was outstanding; chocolate, cherry sorbet and pistachios--a marriage made in heaven.

In our room (deluxe large double) there were cobwebs across the window alcoves (too many to suggest the room had been cleaned), 3 woodlice in the bathroom, a spider in the bath and a piece of dried pasta underneath the glass on the desk. Finally on cleanliness, the two robes in the wardrobe, one was untied and looked as if it had been work - disgusting! \n\nThe shower did not work and mentioned this to the front desk. When fixed, my partner had a shower and ended up scalding herself, as there was at least a 3 minute lag between changing the temperature. In the room, the 'extras' were more than disappointing, a small still and sparkling water which were warm (granted there's not fridge but surely a five star should offer ice) and plastic UHT milk which is more suited in a travel lodge (again, this is fine in a regular hotel but at this price point others go further) \n\nAt this point we were so disappointed we decided to leave. To give credit, the manager at the time was very apologetic but could not do enough to change our experience - the birthday was ruined. I waited before posting this as I assume this is a one off based on the other reviews, I was promised a call from the manager the next day to discuss, however two weeks have now passed. \n\nI'd recommend if its a special occasion, other hotels will deliver a better experience, an experience befitting the price",2,negative

From the moment you drive through the electric gates you can\u2019t help but be impressed by the hotels setting. Castle Combe as a village is beautiful and has to be seen to be believed and no wonder it has been used for the settings of TV and films as it\u2019s not been changed at all over the years.  We stayed in Castle Combe for the first time last year and found this hotel and knew we had to visit. We booked one of the plush rooms in the cottages, its large bed was comfy and the bathroom is to die for. A large walk in shower room and side by side roll top baths with a TV in front, what can I say. The only slight issue with the room was the over complicated light system they have, there are two remote hand held controllers by the bed which switch things on\u002Foff or in our case it didn't. It froze and the electrics to the room had to be reset to sort it but it never happened again. All the staff were very friendly and only too willing to help with any request. We were lucky as the weather was fab and you couldn't beat sitting out on the lawn and just relaxing, it\u2019s so peaceful. There are a good selection of drinks, if not a bit pricey and don't forget to add the service charge for the restaurant and the bar. We were looking forward to our evening meals in the one star Michelin star restaurant and weren't disappointed the food was fabulous. Having said that the service on the 2nd night was a bit slow for this class of restaurant and would have expected it a bit better but we were not in no major rush and our waiter was more worked up about the delay from the kitchen than us. All in all we had a great time and would not hesitate on recommending this hotel and if you play golf it\u2019s a double bonus as it has its own course.",5,positive

I imagine this is due to the age of the property. Still, the accomodation was as charming as you could imagine. \n\nFoodwise, the Bybrook wowed us again. A seven course taster that rocked on all levels...that ultra fine, mega-moreish Tagliatelle & Mushroom dish and that lemon and raspberry desert....

The lodge is a perfect base for a golfing stay within a stone\u2019s throw of the course, range, pro shop and clubhouse.  The lodge itself is in great condition although the living room space is quite small.  We were lucky with the weather, so sitting outside the lodge overlooking the 18th was perfect for a few post round beers.\n\nAll our group found the golf course really enjoyable to play.  There are many elevation changes making for some spectacular tee shots.  The course offers much variety and would be a challenge for golfers of all levels.  The condition of the course was excellent overall.  The greens ran true and fast and all playing areas were maintained excellently.  The bunkers were a little light on sand during our visit, but I believe that was to be rectified during the week following.  The practice facilities were also excellent with a grass range and a full short game area.  I would recommend the use of a buggy as the course has some long walks between green and tee, often uphill.\n\nAll the staff we came across both in the pro shop and the clubhouse were a great help during our stay.  A special thanks to the guys in the pro shop who put together a certificate and free round voucher for a member of our party who had a hole-in-one.\n\nOverall, I couldn\u2019t recommend the Manor House more for a golfing trip, everything is top notch from the facilities to the service.

First off if you have never visited Castle Combe, what a sweet little village, very much favored by tourists but as a Brit - I must admit, not known to me at all!  The Hotel is like a higgledy piggledy medium sized manor house with lovely cottages and we were treated to a room in one of the cottages, which was so special.  All mod cons were available, particularly important in the bath room, the bed was King Size (and these days I just can't cope with a double!).  The only niggle is that in our cottage, we had 3 rooms in total and on the 2nd night of our stay the other 2 rooms must have been invaded by some of the loudest, noisiest and most inconsiderate people in the world.  Not the fault of the hotel but by midnight, it was a bit much!  Breakfast is held in their main dining room and was great day 1, day 2 not so enamoured with it... perhaps it was the chef....I should have sent my cooked breakfast back but did not have the time or inclination to deal with a fuss.  The staff were great and that was a blessing as the atmoshphere can appear a little stuffy, well-to-do but amazingly luxurious.  The Gardens and Grounds were so impressive and left us feeling like royalty as we drove up.  The Golf Course is wonderful - a real test of golf for the uninitiated.  We were hardy enough (or brave?) to walk the first round, but after 4 heartache hills opted for the buggy that everyone else seemed to favour for our next 2 rounds.  But what a superb and well built course!  The only disappointment is our deal included dinner - turns out this was in the club house which was OK.  But compared to the high standards of the remainder of the experience, that was a let down.  The food was as one might expect of a mediocre Golf Club House, but not much better.  Having said that, our overall experience was good, we very much enjoyed our stay, would recommend it and will be back again.",5,positive

Several times the dishes came out and were immediately taken back into the kitchen as I assume the waiters were unsure which dish had the allergy free dish.\nA couple of the dishes weren't as warm as they could have been, maybe due to being bought out then taken back but overall the food was very good and my wife didn't suffer any reaction to the food.\nThe sommelier was excellent although the first wine arrived 50 minutes after we had ordered the menu.\n\nThe waiters were very attentive but overall I felt they were a bit rushed and not as organised and smooth as they might have been - was just not as good as it might have been.\n\nAfter a nightcap we returned to the room, which was very well presented and very comfortable.\n\nWas lovely to return to such a special venue although the team were not quite as efficient as they could have been.  \nIn my view, quite a bit to do if they wish to obtain that second Michelin star.",4,positive

The afternoon and dinner service seem to have a different set of staff, and they are not as friendly or attentive.

The hotel itself has a wonderful charm and lots of nooks and crannies that make for great discoveries. We spent our first night in the main building of the hotel and a further 2 nights in the cottages. Our room in the hotel was one of the best family rooms I have ever stayed in, beautiful bed, with a sofa bed and an additional single bed for our children and there was still plenty of space to move around. There was also a nespresso machine and a cute little box that contained tea making facilities. Lots of lovely little features. Bathroom was huge and had all the mod cons. This is something the hotel has got spot on, in that it retains the charm of a country hotel but also affords all the mod cons that we rely on. I definitely preferred the room in the main building to the cottages. \nHere\nIn the cottages we were given 2 rooms but our room didn't afford much privacy as we could see people walking past inside and outside of the grounds and our bathroom particularly left us feeling exposed. Our children's room was better and a great size. Ours while having a four poster bed felt dated and was quite dusty with cobwebs, pet hate of mine. \nService throughout was attentive without being intrusive. Front desk was particularly good. Felt waiting staff in restaurant were generally good but not to the level of elsewhere. We ate in the restaurant on the first night, food was lovely but came with a price tag to reflect it! To be honest you could have food just as tasty in nearby pubs as there are some excellent ones near by and in Burton. \nThe wedding party laid on a buffet for the sat night which was good, but not to the level that I would have expected. Food and service for the wedding day itself was excellent. It was very efficient, probably the best throughout our stay.\nOverall breakfasts were excellent and plenty of variety. Downside on our last morning (which was part of our wedding) service was extremely slow.\nOverall I would have given this 5* had it not been for a few of the minor issues.

However we were disappointed to be given a room that was on the main exit road from the hotel with large windows to the front through which random walkers and car drivers were only keen to look through as they walked past. This also meant that it was quite noisy. The windows to the rear of the room were also overlooked so there was absolutely no privacy at all. We had a lovely ensuite bathroom, which was very nicely finished but the toilet was separate from this and had no hand washing basin in it. This meant that you had to walk from the toilet through the bedroom and into the bathroom in order to wash your hands. Not ideal! The room also lacked any complimentary biscuits and although there were six varieties of tea available there were only two teabags for each. This meant that on the day we arrived and made ourselves a drink we couldn't have another cup of tea until after our room had been restocked the following morning. I'm not a fan of Camomile, fruit tea, Earl Grey, etc. A few more of each variety would have been more acceptable. No complimentary slippers were available either in a room with beautiful but very cold stone flooring and all this for a room that we paid well over \u00A3200 for.

For anyone considering a fairy tale wedding then it's a no brainer, especially as the pretty Castle Combe church is about a 2 minute walk away (literally behind the hotel car park), the hotel is in beautiful country setting where wedding photographers can go wild, in addition to rooms in the main hotel, there are cottages that run from the hotel to the church\u002Fcastle combe high street, and going by the others guests comments; the rooms are as impressive as the last\u002Fnext, where else do you get to watch a tv while having a bath or have a shower big enough for six people ?, being an old manor house it's like a maze with corridors and stairs going off in all directions, the food; things I'd never even considered or would touch; were simply stunning, and tasted like heaven, but still not as good as the bacon butties and chips served later on ;-), all the staff were incredibly polite and helpful and thanks to the weather the main event was easily the best wedding, bar mine of course ;-), that I've been to, and that's down to this incredible 5 star hotel.\n\nA fitting day and hotel for a great couple, \n\nNiggles, very minor; the room was a little cold in the morning, and the cooked breakfast was far from being the best (not much choice and rock hard\u002Fovercooked but very tasty\u002Fexpensive sausages). \n\nIf you can afford it and want to stay near Bath, then I can wholeheartedly recommend this hotel, and if you're a bride looking for a stunning location you've found the perfect venue.

We are a family of four - mum, dad and two daughters (aged 16 and 13).  We booked two Plush rooms and specifically requested that they be in the main house.  We were given Daniel's Ground and Crewscroft, both of which are beautiful rooms and are indeed in the main house.\n\nThis is our third visit to the hotel and most things were as excellent as our previous stays. Except slightly slower and confused service in The Bybrook for our first night's evening meal from the taster menu, eg. we chose the wine flight and wines were being poured well before the accompanying dishes arrived so although we waited as long as we could, we ended up drinking the wine before the food arrived.  I made the sommelier aware of this and he did top up our wine so all was good.  The food from both the taster menu and the a la carte menu was lovely.\n\nThe other surprising cutback was the lack of turn down service in the evening.  I guess it's not something which is needed, but of course, the price of a stay doesn't decrease in line with a decrease in service.\n\nThe rooms:  I'll start with our daughters' room, Daniel's Ground.  It's a very quiet, tucked away room with it's own entrance corridor.  The room is quite dark, but beautiful with plenty of typical character and beautifully furnished.  The bathroom was large and had everything you would need including a bath and a walk-in shower.  Sadly, it did not have a good view - overlooking various rooftops and our daughters notified us that the TV was so far away from the bed that the remote could not be used, which was annoying for them.  They also had difficulty opening and closing the drawers - a small point, but again, annoying.\n\nCrewscroft: a beautiful, bright, well furnished room with a wonderful view over the front lawn through two large sash windows, both with window seats.  The main downside with this room is the constant noise from above, particularly when they used the stairs, under which our room's WC and shower is located so keeping the door closed was essential.  No fridge provided so fresh milk went off overnight. But the main negative for me was the shower room - it's not much more than an understairs cupboard, which was dark, cold and claustrophobic, unlike the bathroom which was lovely and spacious with great lighting.  It would have been helpful to at least have a shower attachment in the bath.\n\nDespite a few niggles, we totally understand that the hotel building is very old and has some quirky layouts so we accept that not all rooms have fantastic views or great bathrooms, but having stayed in five different rooms over the years, some things remain constant - comfortable, beautifully decorated & furnished and oodles of character & charm.\n\nAnd, where possible, please provide a small fridge instead of a Dyson hairdryer!!\n\nAs always, all staff were very friendly, accommodating and helpful.  Yet again, despite there being some familiar faces, we didn't get their names which is shameful on our part, but all were excellent.\n\nDrinks in the bar are a bit pricey - I ordered a White Russian cocktail and it came in a martini glass making it a fraction of the size it should be so I did feel a little ripped off.  Some drinks are definitely slightly better value for money than others.\n\nAll in all, we will definitely be back as the look and feel of this hotel, together with it's grounds and the village itself, cannot be beaten - it's just beautiful beyond words.",5,positive

Overall the experience was fantastic, the Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful.   On arrival we were offered a cottage, which although only a little stroll away from the main Hotel (and we knew that it would be lovely) due to the weather being wet and windy we asked if we could stay in the main Hotel.   The staff obliged by showing us a couple of rooms, one of which we chose.   The rooms in the main Hotel are, as they said were more traditional than the cottages, quirky as expected but well equipped.   Dining in the By Brook Restaurant was an amazing experience from the excellent food to the friendly knowledgeable staff made the whole experience fantastic.\nIf we had to criticise and having stayed in quite a few Hotels of his standard there were a couple of points worth mentioning.   Firstly on arrival we parked outside the main entrance, we felt that someone should have come out to greet us, then after discovering we were staying ask about our luggage and show us to the reception.   Instead we struggled to open the front door but were kindly assisted, from the inside by another customer rather than a member of staff! The sorting out of the room, taking our luggage to the room and parking my car was faultless as was the rest of the stay until we came to check out.   After settling our bill and taking into account we had all our luggage we were expecting someone to bring our car to the entrance so we could load up and leave.   Instead we were handed our car keys and told where the car was parked at no point did the member of staff ask if we would like assistance with our luggage to the car or if we would like the car brought to the entrance to save us the walk up hill with our luggage!   It's  just a small couple of points but with this standard of Hotel it would be expected and sometimes it's the attention to detail that makes all the difference for a return stay and a full 5 out of 5 rating.",4,positive

The Manor House Hotel has a head start on many country house hotels, just because of its location. The Manor house and row of cottages are picture perfect in their surroundings. The cottage I stayed in (Braun) was excellent, with a snug sitting room and bathroom downstairs and lovely bedroom upstairs. There was a comfortable dog basket and dog blanket in the sitting room and my dog was very settled in the cottage. The main house has many rooms with fires and armchairs, but if you have a dog, then you are restricted to the entrance hall only, which is not ideal as it is the room with the most pedestrian traffic and it is not relaxed or homely, and this is the main failing of The Manor House Hotel. When I stay at a country house hotel, I want it to feel warm and welcoming, like a home from home. The best of these manage this effortlessly (such as The Grove in Narberth, Pennyhill Park, The Pig, Whatley Manor, Oakley Court, to name but a few). The Manor House Hotel misses this feeling by a country mile. Some of the staff are amazing, but some are overly precious about the hotel and behave as if the guests should be grateful that they have been allowed through the doors, and if you have a dog, then don't even think about getting comfortable in the main house, you really are not welcome. The Management should go and spend some time at some proper 5 star country house hotels and see how to make their guests and dogs feel welcome, or just decide not to accept dogs, but don't persist with this half hearted effort.",3,negative

We had a TV in the lounge, bathroom and bedroom.  We didn't want to leave our room as we felt too comfortable.  At the bottom of the stairs to our suite was a library of books, CD,s and DVD,s for residents to choose and take to our rooms. Several bars and lounges are there for your entertainment, relaxation and refreshment. There is even a resident pianist. A very interesting gentleman who has worked with many famous people can recollect a whole host of facts.  The evening meal in the award-winning Bybrook restaurant (named after the river that runs through the hotel grounds) was outstanding. We chose the tasting menu but you can also have a la carte. Plenty of warm home made breads of different varieties. The only downside to this hotel is the cost of drinks, absolutely extortionate. After an above average peaceful sleep breakfast in the mornings was another treat to look forward to.  A walk,in the grounds is a must with its beautiful medieval and gothic gardens. There are also small individual cottages with log fires in the grounds of the hotel and golf buggies to get around if required. This 5* family owned hotel is a must for anyone who wants to feel special",5,positive

The \u201CTraditional\u201D afternoon tea, the afternoon tea served with a pot of Gin or the afternoon tea which was served with a glass of champagne, all ranging in price from \u00A329.50-\u00A339.50.\nMy mum and I both opted for the traditional afternoon tea, and there was a range of about 15-20 different types of tea to choose from! The tea came out very promptly, shortly followed by the tiered cake stand which contained a variety of sandwiches, cakes, pastries and sweet and savoury scones and served with butter, cream and jam. \nThe tea pot contained enough tea for 4\u002F5 cups per person, and the food was more than enough for 2 people. The food itself tasted absolutely divine and I would most certainly give it 10\u002F10. The Scones were still warm when they came out and the smaller bite size desserts on the top tier were beautifully delicate and light. \n\nThe service was absolutely impeccable by all members of staff from start to finish which really added to the exquisite nature of the occasion.

Its 15th century stone cottages are built in typical Cotswold style, constructed in stone with thick walls and roofs made from split natural stone tiles.

Today, in addition to welcoming tourists and film makers, it is a sanctuary for wildlife.\n\nThe highlight of our time in Castle Combe was our visit to The Manor House.  Our group of nine was greeted by Stephen Browning, the formally dressed general manager.  We were served tea, coffee and shortbread in an elegant sitting room that made us feel like lords and ladies of the manor.

Only problem was that upgraded rooms were only available for one night and so we had to settle for \""cozy\"" - the bottom tier. I was a bit anxious but \""cozy\"" was gorgeous!  Large and spacious with a king size bed, huge TV, plenty of storage and seating. Our view was of the beautiful front gardens. Bathroom again large, lots of fluffy towels and like the room, spotlessly clean. The Manor has so much atmosphere and history. Warm and cozy with a maze of rooms. In each room, it's hard to know which squishy sofa to sit on to relax and read the paper. The staff are incredibly attentive without being intrusive and they go to great lengths to accommodate every request. Don't miss afternoon tea - well worth every calorie. Really excellent. The only problem staying at The Manor is that it is hard to make yourself leave. You really could easily relax all day, stroll around the vast fantastic grounds or sit in the sun outside the Castle Inn and have coffee. Bliss - really a hotel NOT to be missed. ",5,positive

We were looking forward to a cream tea in wonderful surroundings. We had not booked but the staff were very accommodating, enabling us to sit in the shade under a tree with our little dog. Sadly the service was not as one would expect of a five star establishment. We were served tea and coffee and had to remind staff twice to bring cups and saucers and three times to bring sugar. No hot water was provided with the tea. The sandwiches were presented with bread that was drying out. However the scones were delicious, although a very modest amount of cream and jam was apportioned with cream tea for two. Overall the setting is exquisite but the cream tea and service was disappointing and was certainly not good value or of appropriate quality for a Michelin starred establishment.",3,negative

The portable \""air conditioner\"" didn't cut it, though staff delivered a second one to help with the heat. Constant cooking smells as our bathroom window faced the kitchen.  I peeked in other rooms that were much brighter with better air circulation.  The hotel claimed no other rooms were available, though we noted it definitely wasn't full for at least two of the nights we were there.

My fiance didn't realise that as he doesn't live in the UK and I saw this when we already left the hotel. This is really an unacceptable thing to do as I think the staff probably did this on purpose just to get rid of those notes easily by giving as a change to foreign guests whom he thinks might not know that the note hasn't been used anymore. So I would recommend this to any international travellers who are coming to this hotel if you eat or drink there and pay by cash. Just be careful.

The waitress was very informative and took the time to explain each of the items on the afternoon tea to us with a huge smile on her face. \n\nThe room was stunning, with a huge bed and Dyson hair dryer and a purifying Dyson hot\u002Fcool fan which gave an extra 'premium' feel to the hotel. The bathroom had a massive walk in shower with jets all the way around - I've never been in such a big shower. The room was warm and welcoming with a coffee maker which could make tea as well from small pods, similar to Nespresso pods. \n\nOverall the hotel was stunning, the room was extremely comfortable with luxury touches but the staff are what makes this hotel so nice; they are all so welcoming, friendly and happy. \n\nThe one thing I would say that was slightly annoying was the number of 'posh' people who think it's OK to speak to the staff like rubbish; we witnessed it a few times and overheard some quite cringeworthy conversations which is a shame considering the staff of the hotel cannot do enough for you. \n\nWe both loved this place and will definitely be returning.",5,positive

The hotel is  set up for comfort with plenty of lovely nooks for peace and quiet, but it also served as the ideal place to celebrate the entry of a New Year. \nDelicious evening meal of an exceptional quality, the wine pairing was a delight. I think Anita is the name of the Sommelier, who chose the wines - she is to be congratulated. The staff were attentive but also fun  and the Restaurant Manager is to be commended. This was followed by a brilliant casino, with very entertaining Croupiers and a fun, enjoyable disco, \nBreakfast on both days was a delight, again excellent, attentive staff and a delicious meal served with plenty of choice.\nWe did have one disappointment. Four of us checked in (two couples) and we had asked, in advance, to be located close by in the cosy rooms, but instead found we were not that near by and in fact, our bedroom was outside the gates of the hotel grounds, just near the pub (Lower P)..Whilst the bed was huge and very comfortable, the room was sadly lacking with no coat hooks and minimal space to hang anything up. The single, small cupboard was not even tall enough for a full length dress to hang. Our room was far inferior to the one our friends were given. No jealousy intended but we were paying the same price and having asked to be in the same vicinity, we felt we were misled. The staff thanked us for our feedback!!",5,positive

It's so atmospheric - a sprawling cotswolds Manor with log fires in the reception rooms. The feel is more of a warm English country house than a sharp hotel - it feels luxurious yet homely. There was champagne and chocolates in our room to wish me happy birthday. Dyson hairdryer, jacuzzi bath, le chameau wellies, bath robes. The extras are exquisite. We drove a golf buggy to the gym one morning - very informal and fun. Good gym facilities. Definitely recommend going for a walk in the grounds.

The room had a sofa and table with 2 more chairs, fridge and coffee maker. I made tea with the Nespresso coffee maker, and pods, which was awful, so requested a kettle and tea bags for the morning. This was promptly brought up with fresh milk. ( so ask if you are not happy is the answer ).  The tea tray had nice large mugs for the tea. \nSo then we realised,in our haste to leave home we had forgotten our chargers. Once again problem solved by a very nice young lady on reception who charged our phone willingly. We also noticed a charging unit for different phones in one of the downstairs rooms. \nOur included 3 course dinner was superb and so politely served. The sommelier knew her stuff. Breakfast the following morning was also politely served and delicious. I always rate the black pudding for fun. The Stornoway black pud got 10 out of 10 !  \nThe history of the house is very interesting and don't miss the Italianate terrace garden up the steps near the front door. There is a leaflet on the history and a 1947 framed for sale notice in reception, which makes interesting reading.

Today, it is picture postcard material and deservedly so which, naturally, means it is sardine packed with visitors.  But not a problem if you're staying at the Manor House Hotel - the place that ruled the woolen roost long ago and, for that matter, still does.\n\nThis ancient home is every romantic's idea of a country manor home, both inside and out but now with all the comforts and expectations of a 21st century five star establishment.  The lanes may be crowded but within the gated grounds here there is nothing but calm, beauty, tranquility redolent of a different era or the life of a 1 percenter.\n\nThe hotel is small-scale by today's standards and that is just perfect for its location.  Our room anyway was huge and lovingly appointed.  Mind you, this is an ancient home beneath its modern appointments so the floors can still creak, the ceilings can be a bit low, but all of this is what imbues it with character and charm.  The staff was always attentive in that wonderful country way, making it feel more like an garden party invite than being in a hotel.\n\nSo, if you're looking for peace, a place to sit out on gorgeous grounds with a book or ear-pods, sip tea and feel fortunate, then this is the place for you.",5,positive
11.43\ca\528765\191624\650274649.html,The Manor House Hotel and Golf Club,"""A very attractive looking country house hotel, set within it\u2019s own extensive grounds but nonetheless no more than a couple of minutes walk to the village, besides the main building there is also a very attractive row of mews cottages which are also available to stay in. We opted for the main house purely because we preferred to walk down to our evening meal and breakfast without having to get dressed up during the current snowy weather. All the staff we came across were very friendly and helpful, and unusually most seemed to be English which tends not to be the case in much of the hotel industry.  \n\nWe went for the \u201CLordsmeer\u201D suite, and this was a very impressive room with great views across the gardens from it\u2019s large bay window and further smaller windows on two other sides. It was really quite a huge room with the bed being centrally positioned with a screen behind it forming a corridor at the rear. A large flat screen TV was up in one corner, and there were the usual facilities such as tea\u002Fcoffee making facilities, ironing board, safe and so on. There was a small \u2018fridge although nothing in it, but then I guess they probably have 24 hour room service. Both the hairdryer and a fan were Dyson\u2019s, so clearly no expense spared. The bed was large and very comfy, and there was no noise either from outside or inside the hotel. The bathroom was up a few steps at the rear in what was presumably an attic at one time, and there was still some evidence of the old roof timbers which were an attractive feature. The shower was plenty hot enough although not quite as powerful as it could have been, and there were one or two other features missing which I was a little surprised about for a hotel of this quality \u2013 no heated floor in the bathroom for example (although the website says there is, perhaps it just wasn\u2019t on?) and no soft close toilet seat. These are of course very minor points though, overall it was all finished to a very high standard. What appeared to be some sort of sink set in to the marble bath surround had me stumped for a bit \u2013 there was a plughole at the bottom but no taps. It wasn\u2019t until I checked the pictures online after our stay that I realised it was effectively a built in ice bucket for your champagne!\n\nBreakfast was served from 7:30 - 10:30 which sounds fine until you realise that check out is 11:00, so clearly you would be unable to leave it until the last minute on the final night of your stay. The help yourself buffet section included all the usual suspects, although the range was surprisingly limited I thought for such a prestigious hotel; there was no cold meat or fish for example, just a choice of two cheeses, and again, just two flavours of yoghurt, strawberry or raspberry. And whilst these were clearly a high quality product, I did wonder why they felt it necessary to import them from Ireland when there are excellent yoghurt producers much closer to home. Pastry choice was just a croissant or some sort of Danish, and these looked as though they had been bought in rather than freshly made. There were though a good selection of juices, including a couple of smoothies, and cereals as well as some prepared fruit and so on. The hot menu offered a choice of a full English, scrambled egg and smoked salmon, or one of the three variations of eggs (Benedict, Florentine or Royale). I opted for the Benedict, and whilst it was a generous enough portion, there was really very little Hollandaise sauce and the whole thing was barely lukewarm, with the ham in particular seeming to have come straight out of the \u2018fridge.           \n\nOverall though, despite a couple of very minor niggles, I thought this was a great hotel with very good staff and I would highly recommend it if you want to treat yourself.",5,positive

The double walk in shower was a great touch too! However, I would say the only disappointment our whole stay was that we couldn\u2019t get the coffee machine to work in the room, so we had no tea\u002Fcoffee in the room. Small thing, but an irritating thing. We have the same machine at home so it wasn\u2019t that it was lack of knowledge.

It is a truly beautiful building and the grounds are stunning.  We were checked in promptly and \nthe very kind receptionist then showed us to our room.  Wow what a room!! I have never been lucky enough to have been given one of the best rooms but we certainly hit the jackpot on this occasion. We booked a plush room but did not know what room it would be. We stayed in Pennylands. It has a four poster bed, a sofa, 2 chairs, 2 tables, Nespresso coffee maker, kettle, small empty fridge, dyson hairdryer(I need one of those now) a huge walk-in closet with safe, iron, ironing board, robes and slippers and a dyson fan. Then the bathroom is just amazing - huge with his and hers sinks, a double open ended rain shower and a lovely deep bath with a tv at the end - pure luxury. Oh and did I mention the under floor heating (that\u2019s another thing on my to get list!). The room was also exceptionally clean - thank you to the lovely housekeeping staff.\n\nWe ate dinner on the first evening at The Castle Inn. Literally through the back gates of the hotel and you are there. Absolutely lovely venue - staff were very friendly and talked us through menu and wines. The food was excellent. I had the steak and my husband fish and chips. We then had two sublime desserts. Complements to the chef as the food was tasty without being hugely salty and the presentation was brilliant. We also had 2 very good gin & tonics - I would recommend the Cotswolds gin.\n\nBreakfast the next morning was truly excellent. I am sorry but I did not get any staff names (feel very bad) but the lady who ran the breakfast room was excellent as were her staff. Nothing was too much trouble and everything was refilled and tidied constantly. There was a selection of cereals, amazing selection of juices, cold meats, fruit, bread and pastries. The cooked breakfast was made to order again excellent food. \n\nAfter going for a very long hike (there are some beautiful walks) some taking you through the golf course. We went for afternoon tea. We were seated in the lounge area. Selection of teas were extensive - I would recommend the jasmine and the chocolate and ginger. I am a chef\u2019s worst nightmare as I am very fussy and also allergic to fish. But the lovely waitress was not fazed by my reaction to the sandwiches on offer but offered me some alternatives without any fuss or rolling of eyes (believe me that happened at The Waldorf - don\u2019t believe the staff member ever did that again). The scones were homemade and delicious - cheese ones with mustard butter and plain with jam and cream.  The cakes were absolutely sumptuous- dainty chocolate mousse, tiramisu macaroons, rhubarb cheese cakes. We were also asked if we wanted more sandwiches or scones - well done The Manor House - this is something that all establishments should offer and in my eyes puts you head and shoulders above some of the London hotels where I have had afternoon tea and never been asked whether I would like extra sandwiches or scones. We were not rushed and were replenished with tea. It was one of the best afternoon teas I have had. It was \u00A332.50 each but definitely worth the money. I think in the summer outside it would be a super afternoon treat.\n\nThank you to all the staff at The Manor House Hotel.  To the management - you are doing everything right. From staff training (leading to excellent customer service), up keep of the beautiful picturesque grounds, the food, the ambiance and the overall customer experience. I would not change a thing. Only one small suggestion. You offer fresh milk for the coffee\u002Ftea but you have to get someone to bring it to you. I stayed in a hotel in York recently and they provided a small bottle of fresh milk in the fridge and also some larger still and sparkling mineral water. It is a small thing but it does make a big difference to customer experience - especially as you have the empty fridges within the rooms.\n\nIf anyone has any questions I would be more than happy to answer. \n\nJust one more thing to say....I very much look forward to another visit.

Some people may want wallpaper and flowery drapes (and the Manor House has rooms like that for those who do), but I was thrilled to have old beams, stone walls, and a fabulous canopy bed. The bathroom was large and luxurious, the bed was comfortable, and the sheets were divine. We wouldn't have wanted to ever leave the room, except for the fact that the grounds and gardens were delightful to stroll in, and the impossibly perfect village of Castle Combe is just down the drive. Breakfast was delicious, with lovely welcoming staff seeing to our every need. We would love to return and stay longer next time. So many historic hotels are sucking the life out of their properties by creating contemporary interiors. I do so hope that never happens at the Manor House. It is becoming harder and harder to find a hotel that preserves a historic feel in the interiors. I would describe the Manor House as \""Middle Ages with luxury and modern amenities.\"" It finds the perfect balance. Thank you for an absolutely delightful experience!",5,positive

If you stay in the cottages the Inn is the same distance from the rooms as the hotel.\nI would have loved to have given this hotel 5 stars however they have lost a star for the following reason:\nWe had two children next door of 2 and about 8 months which  were extremely noisy after 6.30 in the morning running around next door crying and screaming etc. I know this isn't the hotels fault and this family are entitled to a nice plush weekend away too. \nHowever there could have been better sound proofing between the rooms or the hotel could have put us somewhere quieter to celebrate our Ruby wedding anniversary\nAt breakfast on the first morning my husbands' toast was burnt.\nOnly one roll of toilet paper in the bathroom, so we run out on the second morning (luckily there were tissues in the room)\nWe asked at reception  for decaf tea bags to be put in the room, as they were serving this at breakfast.

It\u2019s not a tourist trap, though, because it lacks the tat souvenir shops etc that usually attend and ruin such places.  Castle Combe has a nice pub and this hotel and somehow retains its integrity.  \n\nOur room was Longlands in the row of cottages which once housed the servants to the great house.  The room was utterly charming, quaint and creaky with a four poster bed and a surprisingly modern bathroom - the vast shower had jets that squirt you from all sides.  The enormous bath also had underwater jets, if you had the time to fill it up.  Wifi and TV reception were excellent. The only downside to the room was we didn\u2019t get a turndown service which you expect at this price level.\n\nThe main house has very early origins but is essentially a Victorian fantasia with a wealth of relaxing lounges and a Michelin starred restaurant, The Bybrook.  On a Monday there were only ten diners which meant we all received stellar and personalised service.  And fabulous food from a traditional a la carte.  We think they offer tasting menus later in the week and at weekends but as we don\u2019t like tasting menus this suited us perfectly.  With wine our dinner cost a hefty \u00A3260 but we considered it fair value for the quality of the cooking. \n\nWhat else can I say?  The Italianate terraced garden is lovely.

Things kept being missed off our room orders which then took ages to chase and resolve as no-one answers the phones! - on one occasion it was actually quicker to walk up to reception and ask someone rather than trying to ring the? madness.  \nThis hotel prefers you to use a very clunky tablet system for service and ordering.  These should be scrapped (as navigation is useless nor intuitive).  Simply scrap that system and invest the money in staff to answer phones. Simple.\nThe outside courtyard of our cottage was not dog friendly.  It had sharp and very steep stone slabs and a seating area that looked like everything was stolen the night before - and then placed in the empty cottage next door.  Our dog simply wasn't interested in going out there and nor were we. (I will try and attach a picture)\n\nThis stay has put me off returning, I hope they solve this simple issue soon.",3,negative

Our dinner in the main restaurant on the second night was excellent and lived up to the Michelin reputation. The a la carte breakfast was good with surprisingly fast service but the selection on the buffet seemed slightly below par considering the general standard of the restaurant.",5,positive

There was a separate lounge, which along with a wonderfully comfortable bed, luxurious shower and bath, had a lovely view of the beautiful grounds. \n\nWe walked around the extremely well-tended grounds which created a beautiful place to wander in the sunshine.\n\nThe evening meals were wonderful.

Each dish (and there were many!) was perfection. \n\nFor breakfast there was ample choice. We had the English breakfast which was very good, although there was a mix up with no bacon on our plate.

The hotel has 15 rooms and 8 suites and we booked a standard double which included breakfast + newspapers. The hotel is tucked away in the countryside close to Malmesbury and just the driveway up to the hotel was breathe taking with a tantalising glimpse of the beautiful garden (12 acres). The reception committee was waiting in the courtyard no doubt alerted by us driving through the gate at the top of the drive. Luggage was taken and an offer to park the car was ventured. At reception we discovered our standard room had been upgraded to a superior room which was a good start. The staff, whilst performing their tasks in a formal, efficient and very correct way, managed to be very friendly also, and this is a miracle of their training I am sure. Our room was delightful and well appointed, a haven of relaxation. The Spa, where treatments were available although we didn't avail ourselves of them, had a steam room, sauna and spa pool. However, the pool whilst ideal for jacuzzi enthusiasts was a bit limited for swimming, but as it's meant to be a spa pool, swimming is not its main function.\n\nWe had booked  our dinner in the main dining room under the direction of two-starred Michelin chef Martin Burge.

But, I always review hotels we stay at and so felt that I should put 'pen to paper' and say what we found. \n\nWhatley Manor is relatively expensive and so we were hoping for something special and in truth it nearly was. You get a great first impression as you follow the sweeping drive down to the hotel and the big wooden gates open to reveal a beautiful courtyard entrance. The welcome and check-in was warm, friendly and efficient and we were informed that if we wanted tea or coffee it would be brought to the room. We prefer to have facilities for this in the room so requested a tray this was promised 'straight away'.  \n\nWe were shown to a lovely large room with quite good views over the garden, we unpacked and went for a walk around the grounds ..... they are truly beautiful. We returned to the room hoping to make a cup of tea ..... no tea tray had arrived. I phoned reception to ask again, the receptionist was full of apologies and promised again that it would soon be delivered. \n\nWe went to use the pool and spa facilities .... wow! Gorgeous! \n\nReturned to the room for a cup of tea .... still no tray. Requested for the third time and finally it arrived!!! \n\nLittle things like this niggle at you and then you start to feel critical. I noticed stains on the fabric covered walls and ceilings, would not have expected this in a hotel of this quality. I tried to use the hairdryer but it was on a retractable cable which kept trying to reel itself up and then it suddenly overheated and stopped working.\n\nWe chose to eat in the brassiere and enjoyed the meal although the service was very slow. I expect  a wait between courses but I don't want to sit looking at a dirty plate for ages!  \n\nBreakfast the next morning was OK but nothing special, we have had better in an airport hotel. The hot food did not seem freshly cooked and there was a poor choice of fresh fruit. There was no salt in the salt cellar and no staff visible to ask for a replacement.  \n\nOverall it seems a lot of complaints but it would be untrue to say that these spoilt our stay. We did enjoy Whatley Manor; the building is stunning, the room and bathroom lovely (apart from my comments), the staff are good and pool and spa are really something special. So perhaps we were unlucky and, as I said, one little disappointment leads to you noticing other imperfections. \n\nDon't let our experience put you off; we spoke to the manager on leaving and he listened carefully to all our comments and contacted us when we returned home so I am sure that he will attend to every point made.",4,positive

I though the decor was a bit 'heavy' with red stripped wallpaper and velvet green couches. Additionally, the shower was quite small. \n\nWe thoroughly enjoyed the delicious Michelin starred dinner, wine, and excellent service at the dining room. \n\nThe spa is excellent: phenomenal treatments (facial and full body massage), but even more relaxing facilities - reclining heated chairs, hydrotherapy pool, 4 different steam rooms and one sauna.

Decked out with gauche faux-alpine artefacts, it's an aesthetic disaster.  \n\nHowever as far as my wife and I are concerned, it's the only flaw with this otherwise perfect hotel. \n\nOur bedroom was lovely and exqusitely comfortable.  The large lounge area where we took our pre-dinner drinks is a treat to unwind in, with its huge open fire and atmosphere of enveloping stillness.  And the dining room, although plain, plays host to some of the best cooking we've experienced.  \n\nAcross the board, the staff were utterly charming and could not have been more helpful.  They also looked like they were having fun - none of them was robotic or stiff in their demeanour or interactions.  Special mention to the sommelier, who was a delight.  \n\nWe didn't use the pool, but it looked great.   After a wonderful breakfast, we departed in an extremely jolly frame of mind.  \n\nWe'll be back.  ",5,positive

The spa was just as amazing as I remembered it and the food just stunning.\n\nThe only two minor points I would make and the reason I am not giving it 5 stars is that the hotel is very hot - our room was uncomfortably hot and we had to open the windows the entire night, and that the wine matches for the tasting menu (if you take it with wine) are not very well paired in my opinion.\n\nThe best part about Whatley manor though for me is that it is a lot less stuffy then some of the other places I have stayed.

It is a perfect place to rest and rejuvenate, though not the best hotel for physical activities.  Our suite was spectacular, facing gardens in 2 directions.  We did stay for 5 days and enjoyed the lovely spa.\nWe drove to town each day to play tennis on a local court to which we were referred by the hotel but for which we had to negotiate and pay.The walking path for which I was given a card for guidance ended abruptly across the road.  Given that the hotel did not make any special arrangements for us, we thought it a bit pushy or overreaching to assess a 10% service surcharge on our entire bill.  That might be nominal for a 1 or 2 day stay or justifiable for special services rendered but a rather large, undeserved payment in our case.

The location of Whatley Manor is excellent, beautiful and peaceful and aesthically pleasing. Upon arrival we were upgraded from the Deluxe room we had booked into a suite (Room 2) which was absolutely fantastic. Having read some of the other reviews I can sympathise on the duvet issue. Our bed was clearly two singles \""tied\"" together though double headboard, which made for a 6ft bed but the duvet was not big enough for this size of bed and my husband & I were playing tug of war in the middle of the night. That was the only downside of this suite though. We were booked into the Dining Room both nights of our stay. I was disappointed that there was only a choice of 2 tasting menus (ex the veggie one) and no a la carte. I also thought for 2 Michelin stars it fell far short of the quality of Gidleigh Park which also has 2 stars and Longuelville Manor which has no stars but 3 red rosettes. Also on our 2 nod night the service was no good. After being shown to our table we had to wait 50 minutes for our first course to arrive which was not the standard expected. The staff were very nice they just seemed disorganised and their was no apology. The restaurant was rather soulless. It is in a newer part of this old property and I think if they had kept to the original style and character of the old property it would have felt more homely and less like a wine bar. The hotel looked to have a great spa but unfortunately we didn't bring our swim things so didn't get to try it.",4,positive

Decor was pretty drab and uninspiring and had very strange  duvet arrangements with two singles tucked in at the sides meet in the middle. It sounds like other rooms may be better but this one was very disappointing and, with hindsight, should really have been knocked back immediately but we had traveled too far and needed to rest.\nRead of many upgrades with previous guests we felt we had a downgrade as the room and bedding certainly had zero wow factor! Only one measly bar of soap to do shower, bath and wash hand basin was pretty poor really! No music centre either.\nStaffing excellent in restaurants not just perfect everywhere with slow service in public areas, even serving frozen clotted cream with scones and fires being let to burn out far too early in the evening! \nHard to make feelings known to some staff as they listened but appeared not to understand which was strange really.

They gardens are an utter joy. We discovered you can have escorted tours with the head gardener. Afternoon tea provided the most delicate pastries in a relaxed but sophisticated lounge area. The service was excellent. This visit left me in no doubt that I would like return and so during the summer my husband and I returned for an overnight stay.

The hotel itself is chocolate box pretty and even in November the gardens were lovely - they must be stunning in spring\u002Fsummer. Inside it is deceptively large, but this dosen't prevent it from feeling cosy with lots of armchairs and open fires scattered around. Our junior suite was generous and well appointed with a lovely view over the gardens and the bed was exceptionally comfortable, although, as far as I could tell, it didn't have air conditioning which could be a problem in the summer as the windows opened over a large public terrace. The highlight of our stay was undoubtedly the meal in 'Dinner', very few chefs have the skill to create a Michelin calibre vegetarian tasting menu, but this was delicious and inventive from the amuses bouches right through to the petit fours, in fact I think it was as good or even better than the vegetarian tasting menu at the Manoir aux Quatre Saisons and that's saying something. The hotel also has a Bistro which is rather incongruously decked out in the style of an Alpine Chalet, something that only makes sense when you realise the owners are Swiss, but somehow it works and the fondu was an unexpected treat.

Details of the Christmas package are on Whatley Manor's website, but suffice to say we were very well fed and watered throughout.\n\nI'm going to find it very difficult to condense this review as I have so much I want to say, so apologies that it's long, but I hope it's helpful!\n\nArrival: The gates opened and a small team of staff were waiting to greet us, introducing themselves by name and whisking away our luggage, the car keys and, it already felt, the stress of our motorway journey to reach the hotel. I could tell straight away that we were going to be very well looked after. Check-in was super-speedy with a minimal number of questions and we were immediately given a guided tour by one of the management team.\n\nRoom: Having viewed the room photos on the hotel's website, I was concerned that I wouldn't like them as I felt the photos make the rooms appear dowdy, small and old fashioned. On the contrary, I was delighted with our room (18). Yes, the decor is traditional but the room was spacious and luxurious with a very comfortable bed, two big armchairs, a TV that can be easily positioned for viewing from the chairs or the bed, the thickest most luxurious curtains I've ever seen and a beautiful bathroom with heated flooring and a separate bath & shower. We asked for our pillows to be replaced with firmer ones, which was done with no fuss. Two issues in the room: The duvet is too small for the bed and the shower temperature wasn't at all consistent. Both issues detracted slightly from our enjoyment.\n\nDinner in The Dining Room: The Tasting Menu was included in our package and we requested matched wines. The food was very good, although for us lacked any particular 'wow factor' and we'd prefer more courses in a tasting menu (they count the amuse bouche as a 'course' when they say 7 courses). However, it was a very good meal with attentive service.\n\nBreakfast: A beautiful array of produce - everything you could want. Continental items are available for you to help yourself and hot items are served to you. Their black pudding is the lightest, fluffiest, tastiest I've ever eaten. Everything is beautifully presented and service is excellent throughout.\n\nAfternoon Tea: A plentiful stand of delicious sandwiches, the best mince pies I've ever eaten, lovely warm scones and excellent patisserie. All served in the beautiful drawing room with a roaring fire, pretty Christmas tree and a harpist playing. Idyllic.\n\nSpa: I visited the spa on a number of occasions during my visit, rarely sharing with anyone and at most three other people. Changing rooms are spacious, immaculate and provide a fluffy robe, towel and slippers. Other robe sizes are available from spa reception. The receptionist even offered me my tall size without me mentioning it when I went for my second visit. That's top notch service for you. The pool is warm and really geared towards hanging around in the bubbles rather than serious swimming. The little outside bit is lovely to get a breath of fresh air and be cocooned in the warm water whist feeling the chilly air outside. The steam rooms and sauna are looking very slightly dated but still super clean and very pleasurable to use. There are plenty of loungers around the pool for chilling out. I had a deep tissue massage whilst I was there, which was excellent. Large, luxurious treatment rooms and my therapist was brilliant.\n\nDinner in Le Mazot: I'm not sure why people are so critical of the decor in this room. It's slightly unusual but certainly not offensive. Food was very good. Service remained excellent.\n\nChristmas Dinner: Traditional but of very high quality, with the excellent service continuing throughout. They were happy to provide us matched wines with each course, although it wasn't something they planned to offer. The whole ethos of service throughout really was \""of course we can\"" to any request.\n\nSummary: We left fully relaxed, feeling utterly looked after and certain that we'll return. Sure, our bank balance was \u00A33,400 lighter, which is a lot for 3 nights, but they certainly pack a lot into that package, the service cannot have been better, we loved our room and I adored the spa. I certainly can't think of a better way to do Christmas.\n\nComparison: The only similar Christmas we've done is the 2 night package at Le Manoir which was \u00A32,700 total cost. I would say the food at Le Manoir is better, service is better at Whatley Manor and rooms are comparable (our room at Whatley was larger than our rooms have been at Le Manoir). The addition of the spa was a major plus for me, as it gave me something really pleasurable to do in-between all the eating, drinking and sleeping.",5,positive

The cuttley we used did not seem good enough for the standard I would expect the plates where white standard ones not the painted effect you would expect, the art on the wall was the bog standard generic cheap art. Maybe I was thinking that a 2 Michelin star restaurant better than you the average run on the mill restaurant. Would I go to Whatley manor again yes but would I eat in the 2star restaurant no",3,negative

I have stayed in many excellent hotels all over the world and it really is in the top 2 or 3 I have had the pleasure to stay in.\n\nMyself and my wife booked 2 nights for our anniversary and, whilst it is expensive, the reason for this is, quite obviously, the sheer cost and cash intensive nature of the business - I counted 80 different Champagnes alone on the wine list, all of which have to be held as stock items alongside the thousand or so (I didn't continue counting for fear my wife would think I was ignoring her!) other wines and spirits. There is a full time gardener with a team of horticulturalists maintaining the absolutely superb gardens too.\n\nThere are many reasons as to why the hotel is excellent, ranging from the immaculate state of repair and condition, the beautiful gardens and the fantastic dining experiences, however I think the most significant reason behind the excellence of the establishment is the staff and their total professionalism. Special mention would go to Andrea, the sommelier, who's encyclopaedic knowledge of the wines was fantastic - I am by no means a wine expert, but when there is someone on hand to help you understand more about the wine you are paying for, it adds a lot of value.\n\nhighly recommended would be the wine pairing with the tasting menu in the dining room - it sounds expensive at \u00A370 a head, but you get decent measures and by the end of the meal you do feel like you have had excellent value.\n\nI racked my brains to see if there was anything - anything at all - wrong with this hotel. I can't think of anything.

We stayed one night in what they class as a standard room. However, it was more like a high end superior\u002F deluxe room, beautiful overlooking the expansive gardens. We have stayed in many 5 star hotels around the world and I can honestly say, Whatley  manor is up there with the best. All the staff are so friendly and welcoming and the hotel is spotless with all mod cons in the bathrooms etc but they have also retained the feeling of a grand country house with beautiful log fires and many gorgeous seating areas for you to chill and watch the world go by. The tasting menu was superb along with the wine tasting. Whilst we were there, we saw delicious trays of afternoon tea pass by and looked around the amazing spa, both of which we had no time to sample, hence why we have just booked for a return visit for 2 nights. This hotel is by no means inexpensive, however, the extra finishing touches and attention to detail deserve the price tag. We cannot wait to return.",5,positive

The opulent public rooms and surrounding gardens and country views are spectacular and it is close to Westonbirt Arboretum so perfect for autumn photography.  We knew it was the half term school holiday but didn't realise until we arrived that the hotel is adults only so even though it was a school holiday week it was very quiet and peaceful. We had a beautiful room with a bay window, large seating area and huge bed. The luxurious bathroom had a shower, bath tub and a smooth marble floor with under floor heating. We had two very good dinners in the brasserie restaurant, the less formal of two and I had a wonderful soak at dusk in the indoor\u002Foutdoor spa pool, a relaxing indulgence after a chilly day of photography at Westonbirt.\n   I do have two suggestions for improvements.  The lights in the bedroom were incredibly dim which made doing any photographic equipment maintenance or reading difficult. I resorted to using my iPhone flashlight.  Also the coffee at breakfast was very weak.  I usually bring my own coffee when staying in British hotels and I regretted I didn't this time.  Other than that it was fantastic.",5,positive

It definitely has the wow factor when you drive up to it and the hotel and grounds are so well maintained, it is truly beautiful. The lounges with open fires still have a magic about them and the welcoming was very friendly. A quick shout out for James who helped us with the luggage and car when we arrived, such a attentive and helpful person with a good character. The front desk was efficient. Our rooms were both cosy, warm and welcoming. And during the whole stay we were impressed with the engaging warmth of the staff. The team in The Dining Room worked their socks off. The food in Mazot was good, the food in The Dining Room was world class, but they are losing their chef soon so the new chef has big boots to fill. I do hope it works out to be as good or better going forward as The Dining Room is a big draw with its Michelin star status. The biggest let down of our stay sadly was the spa, it does have friendly staff and it is very clean, but it's become far too commercial, there are too many day spas sold, the pool area was full to overflowing at times with a lack of beds and it felt far too busy. We struggled to get treatments booked for the first time ever and it's because the flow of outsiders are filling the spa slots up. And to cap it all at the end of our treatments we were sold to, in fact oversold to, in terms of pushing their own products. Which is cheap, so please stop it. This is the first time we have ever come away feeling unsure if we will come back. I have scored 4 out of 5 as it's better than a 3 but it's not the 5 it used to be.

Negatives: Sadly, our favoured room had a prior cigar smoker (yuk) so we were offered another fresh smelling room (not quite as nice). Formal dining can be spoilt by the poor dress code of a few diners- time to review the dress code rules? Le Mazot Swiss chalet style brasserie feels a bit dated now - time for a makeover?

First the good stuff; the lounges and grounds are lovely and the service we got during the day was great. It really is a nice place to wend away a few hours over a cream tea or similar. Our room was decorated to a generally excellent standard, though I have to admit the decor was a little 90's for my liking. If I'm staying in an old Cotswold hotel then it would be nice to have the decor in keeping; the cherry wood panelling was a bit out of keeping. The tech to control the lights was also a bit baffling (and I'm quite used to that sort of thing). However the main disappointment was dinner in the brasserie on a number of levels. Again the ski lodge decor is a bit weird, but the main problems were inattentive service (we had to get up and find someone every time we wanted wine or food orders), and the standard of the food. It was generally ok, but not what I was expecting, and the vegetarian gnocchi I had was downright bland. Overall it is a lovely building, but it could be so much more with a bit more attention to detail on a number of fronts. Disappointing as I'd been looking forward to visiting for quite some time and it didn't live up to my expectations.",3,negative

Im no professional blogger or writer, but have been keeping an eye on, and visiting this place for years so feel qualified to go a little in depth! It was a privilege last year to meet Martin Burge, turns out we both went to college in Bristol! A true inspiration to an amateur cook like myself. Then later in 2016 I read Martin was off to pursue other projects and we had a booking in late December. So we were obviously keen to experience, well what exactly? It must be so hard when a reputation is built for an establishment, then a key person changes. Must be like replacing a musician in a successful band. However, Martins menu was being still cooked until the new menu is ready, later in January i believe. To be frank, it was staggering. The Turbot was so well cooked I actually laughed at it could be cooked so accurately, fish is so difficult in my experience, 20 seconds either way can ruin fish. Equally as good was the sauce, 4 of us started eating looking down, when we tried the sauce we all looked up together in unison.  We spent a few minutes trying to guess the ingredients until we asked the staff, who of course new the herbs involved, just brilliant. Later we had the cheese course. I must thank Samuel (hope that is correct) we were quite novices at fine cheeses, but he explained every single type in detail, we had a great choice, he was also humorous too, many thanks to him. Finally, and one of the most important, was the staff. Its such a friendly fun place, with relaxed, witty staff. We will be back in a few months as a completely new menu is being planned. So great memories and more to look forward to. Best of luck",5,positive

It was really very good.\n\nIf you're reading this review with a view to making a booking. You should it's a great place and a world away from the stresses of everyday life.\n\nArrival through the automatic wooden doors to the courtyard is impressive, as is having a member of staff waiting to greet you, take you bags, park your car, check you in and give you a tour of the building. \nOur room was large and well appointed, everything worked and it's clear they invest in proper maintenance. That said the rooms feel a little dated, the d\u00E9cor is in keeping with the building but the technology feels a little out of date.\n\nWe booked for dinner, bed and breakfast. The 2 star restaurant being the main reason for our visit. So it was a disappointment to find out on arrival that the chef who led the team to achieve the accolades had left toward the end of 2016 and we'd have our meal prepared by a new chef with a new menu. The number of courses had changed, so had the price and the style. \nBasically we didn't get what we had booked, if we'd have known in advance we would have cancelled our booking and gone elsewhere.\n\nThe spa is very nice. It's really excellent at 0800 on a Sunday morning, not so great on a Saturday afternoon when it's basically full of people. Get there early to grab a lounger by the pool!!!\n\nDinner was actually very nice on the whole. However, more courses doesn't make it better. They struggled to deliver 12 genuine courses. But some of the food was excellent:\nOyster course was very good, delicate flavours and nicely balanced.\nScallop and Chorizo was great, as was the cod.\nThe first half of the menu was fish biased and really nice. Strong Japanese influence.\nDesserts were a disappointment and felt like an afterthought. But we don't like it when restaurants revert to serving chocolate in multiple ways at the end of a meal. It's easy and lazy.\n\nI'm sure they will improve from where they are today, as the menu gets refined and the team gets stronger. But I struggle to accept the restaurant as 2 star standard, it's good but not that good.\n\nThe not so good bit of dinner was the Chicken fat custard. Firstly the waitress introduced it as the oyster course! Secondly, it was just nasty. \nFor the first time ever at a top restaurant we actually left some courses because they just didn't taste very good. \n\nOur favourite line of the night was: \""and this is your bread course\"". Yes, they actually tried to claim that giving you a bread roll and some butter was a 'course'.\nThe bread was very nice as was the butter (Excellent in fact) but it wasn't a 'course'. We didn't actually have any cutlery at the time the bread course was delivered or for some time after so had to resort to breaking chunks of bread off and using it to scoop up the butter. Not sure if that was the intention?\nAs it turns out we were really pleased we had a bread course. If we hadn't then we would have left the dinner table hungry. \n\nThe building and grounds are fantastic. There's an understated elegance about the place. Really worth the cost of the stay.\nNote to the management: Turn the heating down, it makes the place fell like an elderly aunts house.\n\nAt this end of the market it's the small things that make the difference, they nearly have it nailed but there is a little more work to do. Some training in customer service, sort out the cost structure and serve more food.\n\nI really don't like places that add little extra charges at every turn. We were left with the breakfast room service menu that stated an omelette would be an extra \u00A310 but there was no charge if you ate in the restaurant. \u00A35 for a cup of tea, that turned into \u00A36 at another point during the stay.\nThey also add a 10% discretionary service charge to your entire bill. If we want to leave a tip we will. If you need that money to pay your staff then include it in the price. \nIf you book an economy class ticket you expect to be charged for those little extras if you book first class you expect it to be included.",4,positive

We've been staying at Whatley twice a year for several years now on the 2 night dining experience package.  We have always before given top marks for everything.  It was always faultless, however this time we are left wondering if we will ever go back.  Our room was the main issue.  We always reserve a superior room as we did this time, only this time is was not up to scratch.  First and foremost, a couple of tiles on the bathroom floor had been completely smashed and just left there.  Not even tried to make a repair, even temporary !  The shower had areas of black mould in corners, and the shower itself obviously had a faulty thermostat as it couldn't keep a constant temperature, fluctuating from boils hot to freezing cold.  The shower head also needed descaling or changing.  The tap on the sink dripped constantly. All signs that routine maintenance has slipped somewhat. The service in the sitting room left a lot to be desired, and that seemed to be due to lack of staff.  On both evenings after dinner we decided to take coffee and an after dinner drink in the sitting room, as we always did, but on both evenings got so fed up of waiting that we decided not to bother and went back to the room. On the positive side, the meals, and service we enjoyed in both Le Mazot, and The Dining room was second to none.  Absolutely faultless.  On returning home, I wrote to the hotel manager.  It took 3 weeks to reply, and apologies were made for the service in the sitting room, but no mention of the problems in the room, which were far more important.

One of us enjoyed the aged beef loin, the other found it quite fatty, and only just warm. Overall most of the courses arrived just warm\u002Ftepid.

Valet parking, swift with the bags and an upgrade to a suite, fantastic! All the staff without exception are polite and attentive.  The rooms are lovely and beautifully decorated, I particularly liked the bathroom and the l'occtaine products which smelt great.  I spent the afternoon in the spa and had a relaxing lava shell massage. The spa is the best I've been to; it is clean, well maintained and unlike Bowood, not over crowed.  Unfortunately only the brasserie was open but the foot was absolutely delicious.  The only negative was when I asked for some chutney, or pickle to accompany my cheese and they said \""no, they don't have anything\"", but with a bit of persuasion they managed to find some mango jam with caraway seeds...complimented perfectly:)  Breakfast was a feast too, but quite pricey if it's not included in your room rate, so negotiate or check when you book.  I spent the next day in the spa too, using the steam rooms and the hydrotherapy pool which is fantastic, with a small crescent situated outside, very therapeutic.  Before I left I had a 90 minute Neutra Bisse signature treatment which was so relaxing and left my skin soft and glowing.  What's not to love I am definitely going back!",5,positive

We had a wander around the immaculate gardens beforehand, through the pretty Cotswold stone courtyards and elegant manicured lawns and neatly clipped bushes.  We sat down for lunch in a lovely, light room with big bowls of fresh flowers on a large table.  We had chosen our food in advance from a set choice but it was beautifully presented and a great fusion of flavours.  Not huge portions but just enough.  Dressed crab, ox cheek and lemon marscapone cheesecake with blueberry lemon confit. (My only negative observation is that the dessert wasn't particularly lemony.)

11.43\ca\528773\292110\480150912.html,Whatley Manor Hotel &amp; Spa,"""We recently stayed for a special occasion and I have to say the Manor and the gardens are beautiful. Unfortunately we had a few problems. It was disappointing because I have longed to visit Whatley Manor for many years.\nOn arrival two large gates automatically open via an automatic sensor and there is a lovely sense of anticipation as you drive into the courtyard. It is a small courtyard with various exits and if you are unfamiliar with it - the front door isn\u2019t particularly imposing or noticeable. We assumed someone would come out to greet us as we didn\u2019t know what to do about the car or the luggage. We sat for a few minutes and realised no one was coming - it felt a little of an anticlimax and we feel that more thought should be put into the welcome on arrival.\nWe had arrived after 12pm and were immediately informed that the room wasn\u2019t ready. I do understand check in time is later. We were advised we could have drinks or take lunch whilst we were waiting. The drawing room was empty and no guests could be seen in the gardens - we decided to have a drink first in the hope that housekeeping would be asked to prioritise preparing our room. This didn\u2019t happen. I believe there was a conference at the hotel that day and perhaps housekeeping were focussing on preparing their rooms but presumably those guests wouldn\u2019t be in their rooms until after the conference. I had seen a photo of what I believed to be the bar online which looked quite contemporary but that appears to be Greys Bar and we weren\u2019t shown this at all and only found it by chance the next day. The main bar is quite small and you are encouraged to sit in the extremely large drawing room which is a beautiful room but when empty feels very formal. \nAfter lunch we were shown to our room (15) which was an upgrade to our original category. This was due to a hotel mix up when originally booking my birthday. We had to alter all our travel plans and eventually had to stay the night following my birthday and \u2018pretend\u2019 it was the day. The hotel were aware of this. The location  and size of the room was lovely and the fittings were high quality but the decor was very dated.\nWe visited the spa and it was very comfortable with sufficient loungers -  something that a number of hotel spas seem to fail to provide.\nLater, we were shown to the drawing room again for our pre dinner drinks.  I was very pleased to see they offered Bollinger Rose by the glass. We had opted for the tasting menu but my husband wasn\u2019t feeling 100% so we weren\u2019t sure about the wine flights as they were quite expensive at \u00A378 or \u00A3150 per person. We chose to select a variety of wines by the glass and this worked very well. \nOur first course was presented at the table in the drawing room. A previous reviewer has remarked on the problems with this. It was a japanese firecracker with parmesan and I think lime - it doesn\u2019t sound as though it should work but it really does. Unfortunately you are given one large cracker between two people on one plate. No thought has been given to how you should eat it, but taste wise it was our favourite of the evening. We were then shown into the dining room, the decor is extremely bland and the lighting too bright, even the candlelight was contained in frosted lights to reduce the ambience. There were 3 tables occupied including ourselves and we were spread out so there was no feeling of conviviality, just a very hushed atmosphere. I had the vegetarian option. My husband remarked his was a little like a \u2018bush tucker trial\u2019. One of my courses was fermented lettuce (kimchi?) served on a chinese style spoon floating in warm garlic oil. The bread course was very good. The serving of the food  and its timing (synchronisation of revealing the dishes) wasn\u2019t as polished as it could be and it appeared that staff were in training. The only recognition of my birthday during my whole visit to the hotel was a mini tart with a candle served after dinner. On the tasting menu it mentions \u2018treats\u2019 as the last course, at the end of the meal a closed wooden box is brought to the table, then opened to reveal about 10 little cubes of sweet treats - you are told you can select only one! Perhaps this was a language issue with that particular member of staff.\nThe hotel needs to change the decor and make the whole evening more fun and contemporary. Everything is stiff and formal. Just because you are fine dining doesn\u2019t mean you have to sit in silence and be bored. I also think the menu isn\u2019t particularly appealing.\nI gave feedback at the time and our bill was kindly adjusted to reflect the issues that we had and I would like to thank the hotel for this. \nBreakfast was perfectly ok but nothing outstanding or unusual which you would hope for in a michelin starred establishment.\nWe visited the Manor at Castle Combe the following evening, the greeting was enthusiastic and warm, the decor was contemporary and yet in keeping with the history of the building. The bar staff were fun. At breakfast, efforts had been made to make the fruits etc more interesting with various additions. Nyetimber was on the breakfast menu as an optional extra.\nI did wonder whether to write a review or not but without these reviews, I don\u2019t think changes will be made and other guests need to make informed choices before selecting where to go for a special occasion.",3,negative

11.43\ca\528773\292110\480884094.html,Whatley Manor Hotel &amp; Spa,"""We recently had the pleasure of an all-too-brief stay at Whatley Manor with some friends. The arrival at the property is impressive: a long tree-lined driveway  and, at the end of this, a pair of enormous wooden gates will open and you can drive into the immaculate forecourt - at the time of our arrival the honey-coloured Cotswold stone was bathed in golden sunlight - pure perfection.\n\nMy reference to PG Wodehouse in the review title is that many of his best stories are set in perfect English country houses, where the sun always shines, birds happily sing and bees lazily buzz from flower to flower. This was Whatley Manor!\n\nHaving drawn up by the front door, several staff members leaped to assist us with our bags and then valet park our car. The receptionist already had our paperwork ready, so check-in was instant \u2013 staff were friendly but professional. \n\nWe loved our room which had a glorious South-facing view over the property's handsome gardens, edged by more rolling fields. What struck me straightaway was the very high level of maintenance and cleanliness everywhere. Nothing looked used, let alone tired - wonderful! Maybe it's having Swiss owners that does it? Our friends also had a spacious and charming room on the ground floor with its own private garden (though they complained about the shower not working properly -we also noticed that the shower temperature did seem to be affected by neighbouring bathroom use).\n\nThere are a number of well-appointed sitting rooms and a bar on the ground floor, as well as outdoor terraces to use. Nowhere was crowded - plenty of civilised space to relax in. Drinks service in the bar and lounge was fine with, I understand from my friends, an excellent local gin among the offerings.\n\nWe had partly chosen the hotel because of the restaurant (in fact we'd booked the hotel just before Martyn Burge departed) and I must say I wondered what the 12 course tasting meal would be like. The good news is that we were genuinely impressed by Niall Keating's cooking.  I - along with the rest of my party - are foodies who dine out at high-end restaurants frequently. The dishes were clean, well-balanced, Asian-influenced but backed by solid classical technique with some whimsical twists. In fact I thought the meal was extraordinarily accomplished for such a young brigade (they serve the courses themselves) and was devoid of affectation (thank goodness no more foams!). One of the best courses was the softest cloud of warm sourdough with sweet brown butter and, as we had the wine flight, a local beer. It was so unusual and delicious! There were many other delicious gems of dishes and the wine pairing (put together by a most-obliging and enthusiastic young sommelier who I remember from when he worked at Cliveden) was excellent.\n\nWaking up the next morning I rang down for coffee and tea that is delivered to your door. Was Jeeves waiting just outside I wondered as I swear it was no more than 2 minutes between calling down before there was a knock on the door and our drinks were on a tray along with crisp home-made biscuits. Our first-floor room was large enough to be more like a junior suite so we sipped our warm drinks whilst admiring the pretty garden and grounds.\n\nBreakfast was fine, though I thought there could have been a couple more staff on service (we kept on having to ask for more coffee, more tea, more butter etc) and I was disappointed that the fruit salad in a hotel of this standing was so poor \u2013 it was about one third apple! Not a berry or piece of tropical fruit in sight. \n\nAfter a final post-breakfast turn in the garden, gazing back on the wisteria-clad building, it was sadly all too soon to leave and return to the real world. \n\nI would highly recommend this hotel (the nearest similar one in \""feel and quality\""  is Le Manoir aux Quatr' Saisons) and will definitely return - more than once!",5,positive

We stayed in a beautiful suite overlooking the gardens so had amazing views across the gardens and the countryside beyond. The room was very comfortable with quality plush linens and amenities.  We could have easily spent more time in our room as it was so comfortable. The hotel itself is stunning- a 19th  century Cotswold Manor House that has been beautifully restored to provide a haven for anyone looking to relax in luxurious surroundings and gardens, enjoy the wonderful walks and the amazing fine dining.\nWe ate in the main dining room as well as in the brasserie. Both meals were excellent. On our second evening we tried the Michelin Starred restaurant  12 course tasting menu that was  exceptional, creative and above all a real dining experience.\nService in the restaurants was exceptional.\nWe spent one afternoon in the spa and relaxed in the tepidarium, laconium , steam rooms, sauna, hydrotherapy pool and also tried the salt scrub shower.  There is a wide range of treatments available including massages, wraps, scrubs etc. I had a massage which was excellent ( being a massage junkie I am normally quite critical!).\n\nThe gardens at Whately are lovely.  There are 12 acres to explore and beautiful countryside beyond also.  The hotel is dog friendly too ( with a few rooms that are specifically dog friendly) so a great place to go to for anyone with a four legged canine friend!\n\nMalmesbury is a delightful little town a few miles away and so well worth a visit.\n\nI Definitely recommend Whateley Manor and will be recommending to all my friends!",5,positive

Given the fact that this is a Michelin 2 star hotel and very expensive, our expectations were of course very high. We viewed many places for our wedding and chose Whatley Manor. If we could go back in time, we would chose this venue again. No regrets. However, nothing is ever perfect.\n\nThat said, we were blessed with nigh on perfect weather and everything went to plan. Jo, the wedding planner was well organised, though after the actual ceremony we did not see her again until breakfast the next day. The staff were, in the main, friendly, helpful and attentive, though I personally was not best please going to look for staff during the reception on the terrace.For a while we were abandoned and I, at times, had to go in search of staff to top up drinks. I also had to ask for soft drinks, despite stating that several guests did not want alcohol. The canap\u00E9s would also have been better served in stages, rather than just put out en mass. In the event, they got cold quickly. But, as I mentioned, we had very high expectations and perhaps I am nit-picking a little.\n\nThe wedding breakfast was typically 'posh food' and in small quantities. However, given the previous canap\u00E9s, the amount was more than sufficient. If I had been a normal restaurant guest ordering the main course only, I would have complained. However, the quality was excellent.\n\nThe  flower arrangements were superb.\n\nOur suite was wonderful and very well supplied with goodies, but would benefit with a little refurbishment in places. Again. I'm nit-picking.\n\nBreakfast was excellent, though my poached egg was a bit runny and the choice of fruit juices a little limited.

She could not have chosen a better time to visit.  Two days of glorious sunshine - perfect.  Whatley Manor is a beautiful country house built of Cotswold stone with very sympathetic extensions and conversion of the stable block. The first thing I noticed about Whatley was the absolute peace and tranquility, once the wooden gates open as you drive into the courtyard you sense that this is somewhere special.  Our room (no 20) was extremely spacious with a lovely bathroom and a view over the kitchen garden and decorated in traditional country house style. There is more to this lovely hotel than meets the eye.  40 seat cinema, beautiful spa with numerous treatment rooms and a vip suite for couples or friends or mother and daughter to have massages and just relax.  As the weather was so fantastic we decided to spend our time outside in the beautifully maintained gardens.  A series of 'rooms' with sculptures, fountains and hidden areas to sit and just relax.  We were able to eat all our meals outside in various areas of the hotel.  Excellent choice of sandwiches and light meals on the terrace and very generous helpings.  The cocktails went down well too. Evening meal was excellent and my daughter who is gluten intolerant was really well looked after.  The beds were extremely comfortable and a portable air conditioning unit was provided as the weather had decided to be decidedly 'non-British'.  Feeling very relaxed the next morning we headed down to breakfast on the terrace.  Continental buffet was all you could ask for and cooked breakfast was clearly made from all the fantastic local produce available in the Cotswolds.  The day was spent relaxing in the spa (well on the spa terrace)   Plenty of sunloungers and towels and when we got too hot the spa bistro can provide cold refreshing smoothies.  I cannot praise the team at Whatley highly enough.  Excellent service, excellent attention to detail, highly professional and all delivered with charm and a smile. If you are looking for a totally relaxing, indulgent, child free but dog friendly stay in the beautiful Cotswolds this is the place to go.  Can't wait to return.",5,positive

The hotel and public rooms are beautiful, the staff are attentive and friendly, the cocktails are fab. \n\nWe came for dinner - the 9 course tasting menu.  We got off to a good start with the spiced cracker - a little messy to eat but a great combination of crispy, hot and salty. The following courses, however were not so great.  Oyster tests many dinners - I'm OK with them but I just couldn't eat the oyster as presented.  I'm afraid the same went for the egg custard with salmon roe, also for the tortellini stuffed with foi gras and the chorizo with raw scallop.  \n\nDespite the counterpoints of the sour dough bread with brown butter (really good) and the mackerel and greens, the overall flavour\u002Ftexture landscape was unrelenting umami\u002Ffatty (and I hate to say slimy).  \n\nI hoped that the meat course would signal a change of pace but the lamb was cooked sous vide with very little browning. The fat was pretty much unrendered and the meat very rare. We skipped the cheese and went for dessert - this was better as some fruit made an appearance and so it did represent something different to the bulk of the preceding menu.\n\nI hesitated to write this review (especially as the meal was enjoyed by my companions) but I rarely have such a strong reaction to a menu. There are some good ideas here but perhaps in working so meticulously on each dish, the overall form of the dining experience has been lost. \n\nNote : The 9 course tasting menu is a lengthy experience and as with all tasting menus requires some stamina. I don't think there is an a la carte option so I'd check before hand if you want something a little less \""intense\"".",2,negative
11.43\ca\528773\292110\515821323.html,Whatley Manor Hotel &amp; Spa,"""My first thanks is for the gardeners who do a phenomenal job looking after the beautiful gardens. The grounds are stunning and so well looked after - certainly one of the highlights of staying here is taking the time to explore the different areas, we really didn't need to leave the hotel to go for a lovely long walk. Boots, blankets and umbrellas are even supplied if you are unlucky with the weather.\n\nThe porters, restaurant and reception staff also do a fantastic job, I never once felt like anything was too much trouble. Equally the spa staff are very friendly and I enjoyed two massages which were of a high quality. The pool area is lovely to relax in which also has a nice outside area.\n\nThe hotel itself is beautiful with plenty of lounge areas. I'm not always one to sit in hotel lounges (sometimes finding them awkward like a waiting room) but these rooms were so homely that it didn't feel strange to do so. Our room (a classic room) was exceptionally clean with a huge bathroom and wonderful l'occitane products.  We also made use of the hotel's cinema which was a real treat and a perfect way to finish off our stay.\n\nThe only reason why I didn't give 5 stars is due to a couple of food issues. We had breakfast three times (twice with room service which was absolutely fantastic) but I was most shocked to see open bowls of nuts at the breakfast buffet. Whilst I don't suffer myself, an open bowl of walnuts, such as what I saw, would have set off a life-threatening anaphylactic shock in my sister - yes, even just the smell. In this day and age of awareness, I am always surprised when this serious detail is overlooked in upmarket restaurants. A lot of hotels, restaurants and airlines now have 'no nuts' policies in place and it is a shame that this hotel does not deem this important. It does not mean that the dishes cannot have nut traces in it for other diners, but open bowls of nuts are lethal as the allergens can be breathed in. I do ask the hotel to reconsider this.\n\nWe also ate in the Brasserie which, whilst the food was of a very good standard (and the waiting staff superb) the menu could really do with changing every other day, or at least have more than one vegetarian dish. The same meal three nights in a row did become a little tired.\n\nOverall, this is a wonderful hotel and I can quite see why guests return so often. We had a fantastic time. If the hotel could just sort out the allergen and menu issues then I literally would not be able to find any faults.",4,positive

The hotel is nestled in peaceful countryside, yet only a few minutes drive from historic Cirencester and Malmesbury.\n\nFrom the moment we arrived, we felt completely at ease.The hotel has managed to combine luxury with a restful atmosphere. We spent most evenings relaxing in one of the very comfortable and welcoming lounge areas. Unlike some other high-end hotels, the extremely well trained and professional staff were genuinely eager and proactive to make sure our stay was enjoyable. \n\nOur room (actually more of a cottage!) was beautifully furnished, with a large comfortable bed, air-con, two bathrooms and a spacious sitting area. Tea and coffee can be ordered via room service, or you can ask for a kettle and complimentary tea\u002Fcoffee to be left in your room.\n\nThe spa is the best I have experienced. The relaxation areas are excellent as was the massage which is tailored to your individual preferences. it is very easy to spend hours in the spa pool!\nThe gardens are magnificent. From wild woodland to formal rose gardens, they are a delight to walk around. A very nice touch is that there is seating carefully placed throughout the grounds. \nRestaurant: we used the bistro, not the 'fine dining' one so cannot comment on that. The food was very good, although after 4 days the menu (which did not change) did feel a little monotonous. So when I expressed a disappointment that I could not have lamb which had been on offer before we arrived, the restaurant manager sorted out a lamb dish for me - fantastic! \nI loved the fact we could look out at the hotel's kitchen garden and see the beans for that evening's meal still on the plant. I can only say that we did not experience the disappointments registered by other recent reviews.\n\nOverall, a great visit and one I definitely want to repeat.",5,positive

11.43\ca\528773\292110\528314249.html,Whatley Manor Hotel &amp; Spa,"""Came here as a special birthday present from my husband, we came here all the way from Swindon for afternoon tea after being given amazing reviews from friends and family who had previous came here. However, we did not get to experience this version of the service.\n\nOn arrival we didn't get asked if we had a preference where to sit, which we assumed was there system. But while sitting every other guest got asked if they had a preference. As a couple out for a romantic meal away from our hectic lives of kids we got placed next to a big group of females who were over powering and loud throughout our meal. This ruined our expectations of a quiet afternoon together. We were placed in a good part of the restaurant but if asked we would of preferred the more intimate sofas, or the nice open windows. \n\nAfter being sat we had a very nice gentleman come offer us drinks, he was polite throughout our visit however we had very little contact with him. We didn't appear to have a main server through our stay which we didn't find very personal. We had contact with 3 servers, none of whom were aware of what was going on with our meal and what stage we were at. \n\nWe first had the tea and scone brought out to us. The tea pot only had enough in it for 2 cups of tea which was fine, but when wanting to ask for more it took ages for someone to acknowledge us and we eventually had to flag someone down after waiting and this then took ages for the tea to come to our table. We thought the waitress had got lost. \n\nWhen eating the scones half way through we were told we shouldn't have had them, and it had been given to the wrong table. The gentleman then said they were for after but we could just keep them anyway as we had already started. This made it feel very unorganised. \n\nAfter finishing this, we then had to ask for fresh plates and our next course. We thought for such a traditional meal which we had paid a lot for, we would of been given better service rather than having to ask for everything all the time. We then had the sandwiches come out, this was the main positive part of the meal. All the food was delicious and can't complain about it. That met our expectations fully. \nDuring our meal different waiters did come and ask if everything was ok, they were very polite however they didn't ask if we wanted anymore tea or other refreshments. \nWhen we then finished it took ages for anyone to come and clear or offer us the bill. At first we thought maybe that was how the service should of been as we were there to relax, however on observation the large group next to us appeared to have much better service, which was quick and efficient. Even other couples sat near us also appeared to have a better experience. This made us feel like we were being given bad service and forgotten in the corner. If they were busy we would of excused this bad service however they were not very busy and seemed to have enough time to potter around not looking very busy. \nWhen given the food the waitress also seemed to of just put a candle on top of the cake, and just asked if it was my birthday. Other groups have happy birthday sung to them and amazing customer service. \n\nAfter asking for the bill we then noticed that a service charge was added on. If we had received the same service as other in the restaurant we would of been happy to pay this, however our service throughout was terrible!! The service was a big let down for an experience which is highly based on the high service experience. When leaving we had no apology for this bad service, and now feel like we will not be returning. \n\nIn conclusion, the food was amazing and definitely worth the experience, however the service was awful!

A simple, single gin and tonic - with the least expensive gin they sell - cost \u00A317.05 including a \""discretionary\"" but automatic 10% service charge. A pint of beer is \u00A37.  I understand that you are paying for the surroundings, but this is just ridiculous.  I left feeling an absolute mug and that I had been royally ripped off.",2,negative

The starters.... A couple of prawn cocktails, a pate and smoked salmon were great.\n\nMains.... 3 portions of superbly cooked Sirloin of Beef with some lovely trimmings and a well executed fish dish.\n\nWe opted for all of the Desserts on the menu to give us the chance have a sample of each.\n\nSince the Departure of Martin Burge at Whatley we have held off going back for a while, unsure if things would be the same but so far so good...

11.43\ca\528773\292110\553330267.html,Whatley Manor Hotel &amp; Spa,"""A luxury hotel, spa and restaurant in a lovely countryside setting just outside Malmesbury, you initially go down a long drive and then can go left to the car park or straight on through the automatically opening wooden gates. Beyond these is a courtyard and the hotel reception with valet parking available. As such, we didn\u2019t have to touch our bags at all, they were taken straight from the car to the room. Staff all seemed pleasant and friendly without being overly formal, although some had quite strong accents and were a little difficult to understand, particularly one of the waitresses in the restaurant. We had been upgraded to a superior room which was very nice, I\u2019m just glad I didn\u2019t pay extra to upgrade which I had considered when booking!   \n\nThe room itself was a good size and had views over the kitchen garden. Facilities included a safe, B&O TV and sound system and remote control lighting with a remote on both bedside cabinets. There was also a tea\u002Fcoffee machine, fresh milk in the \u2018fridge, and complimentary bottled water, crisps and chocolate. The bed was absolutely massive and very comfy, although the room was far too hot. There was no air conditioning in the room and the hotel guide in the room said to turn the thermostat on the radiator down. But the radiator was barely on, that wasn\u2019t the source of the heat. That, together with some noise from other rooms, meant we didn\u2019t sleep quite as well as I\u2019d have hoped. Not sure what the noise was, it wasn\u2019t voices or TV, but sounded like someone continually walking back and forth in heels on a hard floor. This went on until about 1:00am.\n\nThe bathroom included both a bath and shower, and was quite elegant with wood panelling on part of the walls. It also had a heated floor which was a nice touch, although the shower cubicle was a little on the small side and the temperature also fluctuated considerably. Surprisingly, there was also no soft close lid on the loo \u2013 a small thing, but something I would have expected in a hotel of this quality. \nWe went for one of their stay and dine deals, and so got to try the twelve course tasting menu in the restaurant. We started in the lounge with a cocktail and this was very pleasant, an elegant room with a real fire blazing away. The restaurant itself is somewhat more contemporary, but still very nice. The meal was really very good indeed, and it\u2019s very difficult to pick out any highlights, although the first three courses (spiced cracker with lime and parmesan, oyster with seaweed mignonette and a tempura battered sweet and sour vegetables) were all quite exceptional. I\u2019m not normally a fan of pigeon finding them a little gamey for me, but that wasn\u2019t the case here. Only the almond tofu was a little disappointing. We also went for the optional cheese course, although this wasn\u2019t the usual cheese selection and biscuits, but rather a choice of two dishes with cheese as the main ingredient. We weren\u2019t overly keen on the soft cheese (a brie perhaps) but that was mainly because of the accompanying truffles which we\u2019re not keen on. The blue cheese though with some sort of crispy wafer was very good. The sommelier was very friendly and helpful and the Vouvray that we ended up with was quite unusual, but most enjoyable.      \n\nBreakfast was a mixture of a help yourself buffet for the cold food and table service for hot. We ordered the poached eggs and salmon on sourdough toast and this was a decent dish with good pieces of salmon and two lovely soft and runny eggs. The help yourself buffet covered most of the usual basics, but with a fairly limited selection \u2013 the prepared fruits for example were just dried apricots, prunes and figs rather than the more usual fruit salad which may not be to everyone\u2019s taste. Similarly the only preserves were a very chunky marmalade, pretty much nothing but orange peel and a jam that was pretty much just whole blackberries. Very good quality I\u2019m sure, but with a croissant for example, I\u2019ve got to have strawberry jam, so I regretfully missed out on these. There were also a few cereals, yoghurts, and so on.\n\nThe spa was very nicely done out and consisted of a circular pool with seating around some of the perimeter with water jets underneath. There was also a separate central area within the pool which also had very powerful jets, and the stream of water emanating from here meant you could continually swim against it if you wanted some more vigorous exercise. There pool also extended through a couple of small openings to an outside area which was very nice and invigorating on a cold day. Sat in a nice warm pool, looking across the countryside was very pleasant. Besides the pool area, there were three different steam rooms at different temperatures, a sauna, relaxation lounge (this had heated seats which were very nice) and a number of treatment rooms.\n\nThe gardens are also very pleasant to wander around, although perhaps more so in the warmer weather. There are a number of lawns, seating areas, lakes, fountains and a riverside walk. All in all, I thought this was a great hotel with a lovely spa and fantastic food. It really is very, very good. Price wise I actually thought it was pretty good value; with our stay and dine package, and taking off the cost of the meal, the room worked out at \u00A3180 which for the quality and use of the facilities I thought was pretty good. Not sure what the normal rate is without the deal, and note that there is also a 10% service charge added on. I\u2019ve never, ever had this in a hotel before, and I\u2019ve stayed in some pretty good ones, so that does seem a bit mean. But overall, highly recommended.",5,positive

Once you have stopped at reception your car is unloaded and parked for you and your luggage taken to your room, all with no fuss at all. You are then shown to your room which on every occasion we have stayed has been beautifully presented and maintained.\n\nWe have had many meals in the Dining room and especially enjoyed the tasting menu. Remember to put a few hours aside for this one though. All the food in the Dining room has been delicious and fresh and served by staff with great knowledge of the food and food allergies, just what you would expect from a Michelin starred restaurant gained by two successive executive chefs. The ambience in the dining room is one of the finest you will experience in my opinion but it does come at a price. Money well spent though for an unforgettable experience. \n\nWe have also experienced food in the former Le Mazot, a slightly dated Swiss themed brasserie restaurant in which more traditional but still professionally cooked meals are served. We did have one allergy mishap there on one visit but no harm was done and the hotel handled the problem with great professionalism. We have yet to try the re-vamped Grey\u2019s Brasserie but can imagine its superb. And who knows, you might even see a celebrity or two there having Sunday lunch!!\n\nThe pool area is kept clean and tidy and on each visit we have always managed to find a lounger to relax on, a quick dip in the pool and a session under the showers and bubbles followed by a swim outside still basking in the warm water and laying on a bed of bubbles looking up at the sky is very relaxing, especially on a chilly day.\n\nThe spa is equally relaxing and although we have had mixed quality of treatments none of them have been bad at all. We do wish that sometimes spas offer a consistent level of treatments, not just Whatley, but all spa hotels in general given the cost.\n\nThere are some great lounges and bar to relax in with big open fires to read a book or paper with a nice coffee and cake, and if you are walking around the hotel, don't be surprised if a passing member of staff remembers your name and gives you a courteous hello - always a nice touch. You can even hire the private cinema and watch a movie.\n\nAll in all, Whatley manor is not a hotel that most, like us, can afford to visit regularly but if and when you do you, will feel locked away in a relaxing sanctuary where nothing is too much trouble and you will feel like royalty for your stay. Always a shame to leave but when we can afford another treat we will be back for sure for another rememberable stay.",5,positive

I have booked the \u201CSimply Spa, Simply Relax\u201D spa package as it seemed to be the best for what I was looking for; a two-night stay that included treatments and both breakfast and dinner. \n\nArrival: The building is beautiful, however it is a little unclear that you need to drive through some locked gates in order to drop off you bag, so I was parked up and walked to the main door where I was greeted and told that I should have driven across and they would park the car for me, lovely sentiment, but pointless after the fact! Check in was easy, and much to my surprise and glee, I had my room upgraded (it was my birthday, but it\u2019s still great when a place takes the time to upgrade their customers). \n\nRoom: Wonderful room, spacious, with a grand bathroom and a separate seating area, perfect for a two-night stay. The mini bar was stocked with water, soft drinks and the yummiest chocolate, such a great first impression!\n\nSpa: Perhaps one of my favorite pa facilities of all the places I have been, enough room to accommodate the visitors (which is not usually the case) \u2013 an incredible pool and steam \u002F sauna area, and fresh towels with ice water all around. The treatments were as good as expected, the whole experience in the spa was wonderful. \n\u2022\tLight lunch eaten in spa cafe; nice enough, as expected, shame it was not part of the package.\n\nDinner: On both nights the meals were eaten in the recently refurbished \u201CGreys Brassarie\u201D \u2013 Very tasty, a typical bistro style menu, nothing out of the ordinary, but still very good. The steak was very yummy, and arrived on a hot stone, however it did become a little hard to eat once it had \u201Ccooked\u201D to your liking. But overall great experience. \n\nCheck-Out: Now, here is where I have my first and only issue with Whatley Manor, and this occurred during the check-out process. Upon looking over my final bill, I was surprise to see an additional 10% of the FULL bill added, now, I always look over my final bills no matter where I am staying, because I have been charged for extra treatments and nights by accident before, but also, I believe everyone should have the right to take a moment to look over all their expenditures and make sure that it is correct. I briefly asked the lady who was handling the checkout if the additional 10% was the hotel service charge (because I had noticed that I was not asked at any point to sign for my meals \u002F drinks, and this would be where I usually add gratuity etc.) \u2013 She then become incredibly hostile with me, stating that this was indeed the service charge and that I should have read my initial booking bill as it clearly states that they would be charging this amount. I smiled, and responded that I was sure it did, but I must have missed it, and I was just checking because in most other spa\u2019s the customer choses how much service they wish to leave, and it\u2019s not something I have experienced yet, but that it was totally fine, and then I continued to read my bill. To my horror, she then huffed out loud, printed out my bill and said \u201Csee, yes I was right there it is right there\u201D to which I just looked at her with complete confusion, as I hadn\u2019t actually argued the point, she then looked away and said again very hostile \u201CI can see you have a huge issue with the service charge, I will just remove it for you\u201D and I stated that it was fine, I would have left a service charge anyway, I was just checking, and then she continued to go on about how I \u201Cclearly have a problem with it\u201D and to be honest made me feel so embarrassed and so flustered I didn\u2019t even know how to respond, in the end I just had to stop her with my card and told her to charge the bill. \nNow, I know this sounds very superficial, but I have never in my life been made to feel like that, I was so embarrassed by her reaction of a simple question, and that she made me feel as though I had a huge issue with paying for the service charge, when in reality I just wanted to know what the extra amount was! I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because of my age and she felt like she could just snap at me, but it was such an unfortunate moment that has really made me not want to return. The added service charge is quite a large amount if you\u2019ve been staying somewhere for a couple of days, and to be honest you should be given the option to suggest your own amount. I have never experienced this elsewhere, and its not an issue, as funnily enough the service was incredible and worth the money, if she\u2019d given me a moment to speak perhaps I could have told her that. It was just handled which such carelessness. \n\nWonderful place however, and I do hope I will come back in the future.",4,positive

I hadn't been to Grey's for a year, just before it was closed for a refurbishment.  It does look a whole lot better - lighter, more modern.\nThe staff were, without exception, welcoming and knowledgeable without being over the top! \nThe menu was a little disappointing - I usually find I'm spoilt for choice when I eat out but I struggled to find a dish to tempt me.  In the end I had the pollock with peas, sugar snaps and hazelnut.  The crust was very salty as if citrus salt had been added making it a little too sharp for me.  Perhaps the chef could look at extending the menu with a couple of more dishes?\nIt was great to see a Txakoli wine on the list.  I appreciate that Grey's is part of Whatley Manor but \u00A348 a bottle seemed a little high, particularly as in the past month I've had a Txakoli at two different restaurants in central London which were both at least \u00A312 less a bottle and just as good.  \nOverall, a great improvement on 12 months ago, but, for me, not quite there yet.

I was met outside the front of the hotel as I stopped the car by not one but two of the hotel staff the receptionist Tara and the car valet. and welcomed. Help was instantly available for the luggage and was whisked away to the room even before I had completed the registration card.  Tara gave my wife and I the briefest of tours showing us where the spa, the restaurant and the bar was and then took us to our room and showed us how things worked in there as there was some gadgetry. \n\nWe stayed in room 19 which is classed as a 'Superior Room'.  A small entrance hall with wardrobes leads into a spaceous bedroom with a very large bed which turned out to be very comfortable. A large bay window overlooks the kitchen garden which was in full use and kept tidy lcoated in the bay window space is a two seater settee. The room was clean and tidy. \n\nThe coffee tea machine was not the best as it only produced small cups of tea but tea and coffee was always available from reception at no extra charge. \n\nPrior to arrival we had been emailed a 'Preference Form' and this had been duly noted by the staff who had provided the 'preferred' tytpe of bedding etc. \n\nPrior to arrival staff at the Hotel had also been helpful in recommending and providing contact details for a local horse riding establishment for my wife. This turned out to be a good recommendation. \n\nThe lightening system in the room is controlled by a key pad and one is provided for each side of the bed it is very simple to use and worked well. \n\nThe bathroom was small, modern, well lit and well designed. The shower is big enough for a 6'1\"" person to have water falling on his head but is not big enough for two or someone carrying a lot of weight.\n\nThere is also a bath which we did not use. Candles and matches had been placed at the end of the bath which I thought was a nice touch. \n\nThe room had also a side window which looks out over the Spa pool building which has one of those eco roofs with grass growing on it. \n\nEvening meal in the Brasserie was nice and the staff were attentive and the food hot. Here I had one of the best fillet steaks I have ever had let down by the overcooked 'handcut chips'. The accompanying salad was fresh. \n\nThe breakfast room was nice and the cooked english breakfast was excelent. \n\nThe wife had a massage and she was very pleased with it whilst I spent time in the spa which allow you to swim outside which was novel.\n\nA walk around the grounds of the hotel is recommended they are very well kept.  \n\nStaff are excellent and the hotel lovely.

Staff around the hotel and at the bar were friendly and efficient, and we really enjoyed our meals.  \n\nFor improvement the only aspect that we thought was poor, was the cheese and biscuits in the bistro.  There was no choice, and the cheeses that came were uninspiring and bland (cheddar, brie, stilton, goats cheese) and were presented with no provinence or sourcing information.

The fine dining restaurant has only a (rather pretentious) 12 course menu, and so if you stay for more than one night - or are there on a Monday or Tuesday when that restaurant is closed - you are forced into the Brasserie, where there is a short, weird, and very expensive menu that includes cheese on toast, sweetcorn fritters and chicken burgers (costing 17 GBP)  - the last served rather ludicrously over a sheet of newsprint on top of a wooden board. Or you can have steak and chips for 36GBP.  I'd recommend giving the restaurants a miss and heading into Malmesbury and the Smoking Dog for a decent pub dinner.\nA pity because the hotel is in spectacular gardens and is beautifully decorated in chic country house style, with a wonderful relaxing atmosphere and friendly attentive service.

The Manor is large but immaculately kept and in such excellent condition - beautifully furnished throughout with some interesting pieces. It is a great credit to the staff that it is kept in this way. Although I wasn't staying overnight, I couldn't help thinking that if the public areas were kept like this, the bedrooms are probably luxurious.\n\nBefore lunch I toured the gardens which are extensive and again extremely well kept and maintained with a wide variety of plants. A credit to the gardeners to keep the grounds in such a perfect state. There was a kitchen garden and I saw someone cutting vegetables presumably to be used in the kitchens - certainly they would be fresh. I couldn't help thinking that I should have come here in summer as there were plenty of places for outdoor sitting and a meal and drinks outside would be great to enjoy looking over the gardens.\n\nThe lunch in Greys Brasserie was very enjoyable and relaxing but I felt it was grossly overpriced for what it was. At these prices I would have expected something extra special which it certainly wasn't. The service was friendly and informal but nothing out of the ordinary which might have been expected given that a service charge is automatically added to the bill. I didn't think much of the environment of Grey's Brasserie as the grey decoration made it seem quite dark on what was a sunny autumn day and there was no outlook on to the gardens. Of course it might all be very different in the Dining Room but this has very limited opening times.\n\nAfter finishing lunch I relaxed over a coffee in the lounge which is large and spacious and immaculately furnished. It was also, unlike many hotels these days, not full of people taking afternoon tea. In fact, although it was a Thursday, the hotel appeared very quiet with few people taking lunch and even fewer sitting in the lounge. I did feel that, because it is such a large place, it did lack atmosphere when there are few people round. There was also constant background music being played in both the Brasserie and the lounge, and I thought that if there were more people around this would not appear to be so noticeable. There was an ornate chess table in the lounge on which I had a game, something not found in every hotel visited.\n\nI left feeling that I would definitely make a return but that it would have to be in summer when I could sit outside and appreciate the gardens. Maybe I would stay overnight when I could sample the fare being offered in the Dining Room. I thought this hotel deserved something better than a Brasserie for its main eating place and maybe I was paying high prices for my lunch to keep the buildings and gardens in such exquisite condition.",4,positive

After we finished afternoon tea we moved to the lounge for some drinks and were looked after again very well.\nIt isn't the cheapest place in the world but definitely worth it for a special treat.",5,positive

11.43\ca\528773\292110\642820388.html,Whatley Manor Hotel &amp; Spa,"""My husband and I stayed at this property for a few days just before Christmas and it was incredible! From the moment we drove up the driveway and the gates automatically opened, it was magic! \n\nThe inside was tastefully decorated with Christmas decor, not too much or overdone but just the right amount. That plus the roaring fire and the 20 foot Christmas tree put us in the holiday spirit immediately. We were upgraded to a suite at check in and the room was simply gorgeous and well appointed. When my husband booked the room he ordered champagne and chocolates and both were waiting for us and both were absolutely delicious. The room overlooked the grounds which were stunning. There was complimentary water and snacks provided which was awesome.\n\nWe had driven in from London that day and we were a bit hungry so we went down to the bar to grab a bite. We ordered and the bar tender said they could bring it up to our room which was perfect. The 2 dishes we ordered were delicious and the perfect size to tie us over until dinner. We were dining at The Dining Room which was an incredible meal and an incredible experience. I\u2019ll write a separate review on that but honestly, you shouldn\u2019t miss the opportunity to dine there. We dined at the bar restaurant another night and again the food was really good and totally hit the spot!\n\nBreakfast was included and instead if a buffet type set up, you order from a set menu. There are several options to choose from for the starter and main course. I tried different things each day and all were truly delicious. \n\nDuring the day we explored various Cotswolds towns of which there are many and within an easy drive. The second day we were there the young man at the reception provided excellent written information on the towns we were planning to visit. These information sheets gave directions from the hotel to the town, places to visit in the town and places to eat in the town. I wish the young man at the reception on the first day would have given us those information sheets because they were incredibly helpful. When they would bring our car around, they would put water bottles in the car. That was perfect  for our day of exploring the Cotswolds.\n\nWe had hoped to schedule treatments at the spa but we waited to book until we got there which was too late as they didn\u2019t have availability. So, if you are going to this property and want spa treatments, book them when you book the hotel. We\u2019ll do that next year when we return.\n\nThe staff at the Whatley is definitely incredible. Everyone we encountered was pleasant, friendly and seemed to take a sincere interest in us, in what we were doing that day and in how our day had gone. There was Chiara that we met on our first night when we dined in The Dining Room and that we saw at breakfast as well. Elliott who checked us in the first day and Atila whom we met during our stay. All were wonderful and made us feel so at home. \n\nThe only negative thing we encountered was the Wi-fi. You had to constantly log back in because the connection kept dropping. For us it was annoying but luckily we weren\u2019t doing any important work. I\u2019m not sure what the fix is, maybe boosters in the rooms?\n\nThe grounds are stunning! There is a pond with gorgeous metal sculptures and Lilly pads and reeds. There are gorgeous ceramic pots and vases throughout the property and also these metal sculptural balls that are amazing. As a matter of fact, the entire property is so well appointed that you can tell that every single detail has been meticulously thought out. The artwork throughout the property is incredible! I\u2019d love to know who makes the ceramic pots and the metal ball pieces because I would love to buy some items for my home. \n\nMy husband and I left the Whatley reluctantly because we really just wanted to stay there forever. We have already planned to return again next year and honestly, we can\u2019t wait!",5,positive

If I said that the steak was \u201Cpub standard\u201D with a so-so piece of beef and nothing special chips I think that would be a fair statement. Truly nothing special or memorable (and it is quite possible to have a special or memorable steak from my experience).\n\nPrice: for drinks for 4 plus dinner with wine and coffee the price including tip was nearly \u00A3500. \n\nOverall then our experience was a so-so standard of food with excellent service and a beautiful atmosphere.

We loved the feel and the d\u00E9cor of the place and were interested to discover when we arrived this time at reception that the hotel rooms had been refurbished.  We were very interested to see what they looked like, because the exterior and communal parts of the hotel have been so appreciatively reconstructed and maintained.  We were surprised to find that the refurbishment of the rooms seems to have for the most part included removing much of the beautiful detail of the rooms.  The room we had looks a bit like a Travel lodge.  Not what we were expecting and not in our view an improvement and certainly not in keeping with the rest of the building.  Such a shame.  When we came on our fist visit, we were pleased to know that there is a choice of style for dining.  We are not attracted to the fine dining experience and are very much brasserie restaurant people.  Except, to our surprise we arrived on the first day of a new regime for eating at Whatley in the evening, where tapas are served as a starter and then the (from our memory) very much more limited menu is presented for the Greys Brasserie.  When we ate in the brasserie on our last visit there was a much better choice of food and it was good quality brasserie dishes.  This was totally to our taste, and at least for the present seems to have disappeared. On our first night eating here, this new regime came as a complete shock and we did not eat well.  Food is important to us, so if this new regime continues, we will not return.  For this visit our second night of eating was saved by the very professional restaurant manager Bruno, who ensured we had a lovely brasserie style dinner.  Thank you Bruno.  Otherwise in the rest of the hotel, we found the service in the bar and lounge to be exceptional, the service in the restaurant in the evening a little slow and lacking gravitas.  Breakfast was nicely served and was good.  We had a problem with our bathroom, in that the toilet valve leaked which meant that the toilet spent all night and all day refilling.  We reported this after our first night but unfortunately it could not be fixed for our second night.  We were told that the only thing they could do was to move us to another room.  When you are only staying for one other night, this is not appealing so we decided to stay and shut the bathroom door.  When we checked-out nobody asked us if we had enjoyed our stay, if we would return, and there was no apology for the noisy toilet.  Not good. We paid for two nights bed, breakfast and dinner over \u00A31,000.  We had a poor experience for our money. So we wonder if this place has lost its way, and who they wish to appeal to?",2,negative

Underfloor heating in bathroom was great! Unfortunately I think there may have been some confusion with the cleaning as our room did not appear to have been fully cleaned on the second day. We had some extra water but the bed wasn't made etc. Someone did come to the room when we had returned (about 2pm) and asked if we wanted it cleaned but at that point we were having some time to relax so it was easier to say no. I was confused though why it wasn't cleaned when the water was provided? \n\nGood choice for breakfast and on the second day we had this in our room for which there was no charge which is unusual and appreciated. The spa was lovely although one of the rooms was out of action which was a disappointment. I particularly enjoyed the salt scrub showers (it really did leave your skin very soft). \n\nLunch on the Saturday at Chef's table was a great experience, although more interaction from the head chef Niall would have been nice, he did answer our questions but I am not sure if he was uncomfortable or busy but did seem like he wanted to get away a lot of the time. \n\nThe grounds and hotel itself are lovely to walk around and there really is an overall peaceful and relaxed feel.\n\nThe only slight taint to our stay was the 10% service charge that is automatically added to the bill. I think this should always be a choice rather than an expectation. Especially when this is across the whole bill, which leave it being an expensive cost (ours was over \u00A3100).

When we arrived, we were impressed by the beautiful manor. So historic and tastefully preserved, with beautiful gardens. We came to check in and a lady in the reception office rudely shouted to the gentleman checking us in \u2018room 9 NOT ready\u2019. It was 2.30pm and check in was 3pm. I know early check in can never be guaranteed but since we have spa treatments at 3.15pm I had emailed in advance 3 weeks ahead to request early check in. I didn\u2019t mind that they could not honour this, I did mind that they had no record of my email conversation (I did) and the lady was so rude in front of a customer. \n\nThe room was nice but very dark, with not enough lights to brighten it. The bath is too small to fit a 5 foot 6 human in! I found the room comfortable but noisy, guests decided to sit outside talking into midnight right outside our room (on the terrace downstairs) which was pretty annoying. \n\nThe spa treatments were ok. We were given a double treatment room, and I noticed that during the treatment it was extremely noisy, on many occasions I could hear people walking past talking loudly, very loudly, so found it hard to relax. The diamond facial for \u00A3150 was a nice treatment but not sure it warranted the price tag. I\u2019m used to paying this for treatments as I regularly have facials at the four seasons and Dorchester in London, so I do know what I\u2019m talking about. \n\nThe brasserie let itself down with service. Our evening meal was very good, but we had to fight to get a waiter to help us. They all seemed to be very busy and keen to take care of some older American guests, ignoring us as a young (ish) local couple. In the end I had to leave my chair to get the bill. Breakfast was equally poor service wise (food was again good), with me having to ask for water refills twice - I had to move my own plate and was not offered more decaf tea when the bag had clearly split and no milk was bought with it, so I had to ask. Again, there was enough staff on, they just clearly had other priorities. \n\nOn check out, I was asked how my stay was. I said \u2018good, but some things were not so good\u2019. No further questions were asked. When I asked to have the service charge removed from the bill (they add a flat 10% fee on top of the whole stay) - again I was ready to explain why that was and was not asked. I think the receptionist was about to tend to some wealthy Americans.... \n\nNot up to par on so many levels, and the worst part is, I don\u2019t think they care about that. They\u2019re in a category alongside the best but not in the same ball park as far as I\u2019m concerned. ",2,negative

The staff were friendly and helpful throughout our stay. We even received an upgrade free of charge as it was a special occasion. The room we had, which was huge, overlooked a courtyard which made the room extra special. There was a note from the manager which also gave it a personal touch. The bathroom had lovely toiletries and theres everything you'd need in relation to amenities. I especially liked the elderflower cordial in the fridge and thought this was a nice touch. I like the little thoughtful things during a hotel stay and this place just kept delivering. The spa was amazing. I treated myself to two treatments which were great. I especially liked the manicure with a male beautician who kept me entertained throughout (so much so I hadn't realised the time and the hubby wondered where I was!) unfortunately I cant recall his name but my nails looked great! The Michelin dining experience was amazing. I liked the way courses were provided in different rooms and especially liked the kitchen visit. It was a great touch to meet the chefs.

You are aware Whatley is outside your normal price range and you have added a few extras that you didn't intially intend to get but you have had a great quality service and the prices you've seen quoted for everything reflect that.  The only thing you know about service charges is that when you sign a restaurant bill you remember it saying service included so you assume all service is included within the prices you've been quoted.    Your friendly staff member gives you the bill and an optional 10% service charge has been automatically added on *everything*.  Nowhere have you seen this.  It wasn't mentioned when booking even if you booked through Watley's own website.  It wasn't mentioned at all during the stay and yet now you feel under pressure pay even more than you were expecting.  It is of course discretionary but not paying feels like an affront to the lovely staff that have served you.  \n\nWe felt extremely conflicted by this.  We normally expect to pay restaurant service charges but feeling pressured by the situation into paying even more on top of a larger than budgeted for bill left a bitter tast in our mouths.\n\nI later found the following in a separate part of the website (unrelated to the booking screens or their associated price breakdowns), \""A 10% discretionary service charge is added to your bill. This service charge is shared amongst the team at Whatley Manor\"".\n\nIf we'd seen this beforehand we'd have not had some of the extra treatments in order to ensure we remained within budget and paid the reward for service.\n\nPlease Whatley, help your more budget concious guests by being transparent about this discretionary charge on the booking and price breakdown screens",3,negative

He told us what we should expect during the evening and straightaway we  were then taken by another member of staff to a beautiful drawing room where we were seated in soft comfortable chairs in front of a log fire. A drinks order was taken and delivered with further advice as to the following steps which were, that we would be escorted to the kitchens when ready, where we were free to quizz the Chef or his staff as to the food & drinks being prepared also where we would partake of several tasting dishes and drinks. Following that we would go to the dining room where we would be served the full Fine Dining menu accompanied by a selected wine list to accompany each dish. That indeed is what happened and we were treated to some amazing dishes and wines from some quite different regions of the world which were excellent.

Inside the furnishings in the lounges are old, marked, outdated and thoroughly scruffy. \nThe 'manager,' who is invisible, has obviously cornered the market in 20 watt bulbs, not all of which are working at the same time.Those that do work cast little ineffective pools of light on   walls that are painted in a sort of grubby grey.  The overall effect is dark and rather depressing.\nDon't give up at this stage because it does get better. The staff, predominantly foreign, are without exception helpful and charming. The service is attentive and professional. We have found the food to be well cooked and presented although it must be conceded that it is expensive. \nWe held a major family celebration here and were content with all that was provided. Curiously,  and despite the size of the party and the likely cost of the event at no time did the manager get involved with the arrangements - the charming receptionist did the lot!\nWe cannot comment on the rooms although friends who have stayed commented positively. \nLike the curate's egg of legend this hotel is 'good in parts'. It could be absolutely outstanding and a jewel in Malmesbury's crown - it just needs to be refurnished, re-decorated and managed  differently. Polishing the brass would help too!",3,negative

WiFi worked fine in the room although I did hear another guest complain that it was too slow.\nI found that road noise was an issue in my room this is due to having a roadside location, (the new block is set back from the road and may be quieter). My guess is that the hotel isn't allowed to put in double glazing due to its historical status and local planning laws.\n\nParking was ok and free.

Now this is a nice room, some if the facilities are basic, but it's a very pleasant place to be. I recently had a big room in the coach house which needed some attention. Redecorating etc would help hugely. It also needed a bit of a clean.  It didn't bother me overly since I wasn't really in the room much, but if I'd work to do I would have complained. I've also stayed in a standard room, which again are nice if sometimes a bit basic. I've never had dinner here, but always eat breakfast here. Which is always excellent.

It was perfectly clean with all the usual expected extras - tea, coffee TV etc. but the whole decor etc was more what I would call 'standard B and B'. It was in out buildings at the back of the hotel.They might have filled all their rooms in my opinion if a more realistic price was offered. The main hotel was lovely, the food great and the location brilliant.",4,positive

The history of its occupation can be read in every room and on every staircase.You have a choice whether to be offended by new lino in the bathroom that doesn't quite reach the badly wonky bath surround or you can take it in your stride. I don't know if planning problems get in the way of improvements but a simple redecoration job would brighten things up. Even the room's resident Teddybear said he was sick of faded lemon yellow paint. One thing to note is the lack of a lift so if you are infirm you might want to check where your room is situated when booking.\nFrom check-in to the moment we left I found the service to be very good and staff, approachable and helpful.  The dinner menu is full of straightforward dishes relying on good ingredients, carefully prepared and imaginatively presented.  We enjoyed perfectly done bass and lamb and took our puds outdoors to the terrace as it had been a sweltering day and we needed a little night air. ( My heart went out to the kitchen team on such a night )  The bed was comfy and traffic peters out so you get a peaceful night's sleep. The ghost failed to turn up. Our full English breakfast and eggs Benedict went down very well in the morning and fruit salad and pastries seemed freshly made.  There's plenty of parking at the back of the hotel and a nice, secluded garden with a funny little summerhouse that should definitely get some work to make it accessible to guests.

Surely if you are serving a sauce then this is more suited to a plate!? My triple cooked chips were good but I had 10\u002F12 chips they didn't fill the serving pan and I felt somewhat short changed, the cauli cheese was uninspiring to say the least, the sauce was watery, not seasoned, no cheese flavour and no sign of any form of Color\u002Fgratin in sight.

The dinner was really rather excellent (and I may review this separately under their restaurant listing on TA), but to avoid doubt, the remainder of this review concerns the hotel itself.\n\nFrom the outside the hotel looks great - an archetypal old English hotel in a historic building in the centre of the attractive old town of Malmesbury.  The public areas are nicely decorated, spacious and have a real \""olde worlde\"" charm about them.  There is also free parking round the back (spaces are a litle bit tight for larger vehicles).\n\nAfter check-in, we were shown to our room in the Coach House.  Granted, we were not expecting the grandest room on the premises, but we thought we should be perfectly OK for one night. The room was small with just enough room for a bed, a table and a small armchair.  The LCD TV was mounted on an angle bracket off the wall next to the bathroom door which tended to get in the way.  The bathroom was also very small with a 3\u002F4 size bath with shower mounted above.  The shower itself was poorly designed for anyone of average height and above, and sprayed water everywhere from a leaky connection with the shower head.\n\nAll of the above are relatively minor issues that otherwise would not have detracted from a good stay.  Unfortunately we had one of the worst night's sleep ever due to the saggy, spongey old mattress which offered no support at all.  Oddly, there was no valance on the bed either which I have never seen in a hotel either.  Our poor sleep was only made worse by inconsiderate hotel guests talking loudly in the narrow corridor immediately outside our room at around 04:00 - virtaully no soundproofing at all.

My husband had to leave at 7.30am to catch a flight, but when he asked the lady on reception if she could help him print his boarding pass she said she was too busy and to come back in 30 minutes!  When pressed, she grudgingly let him use the computer in Reception - this was 7,30am on a Sunday morning; hardly peak time!!!.  Breakfast was good and the staff in the dining room friendly and helpful.  Check out was a low point as (the same) lady was on reception and she asked if I was happy with the stay.  When I told her the bed was uncomfortable and that the shower was awful she could not have been less interested.  No apology and no suggestion that they would look into either issue.  Terrible customer service.  They should not charge \u00A3165 for a room like this if they don't furnish it to an appropriate level, or assume that guests are happy to put up with Victorian plumbing because the hotel is old and interesting - something they make a big play on.",2,negative

The Old Bell in Malmesbury provides the ideal hotel while visiting. One of the oldest Hotels in England, with a proud history as an \""annex\"" to a much respected Abbey and center of learning, the Old Bell exudes charm, not in an article way but in a genteel, charming and absolutely delightful way. Furnished largely in a style reminiscent of some years passed (but tasteful, clean and well maintained) an \""at home\"" feeling is immediately exuded. The service is excellent. The bedding is comfortable as are the room sizes. The prices are most reasonable. Immediately adjacent to the Hotel are two must see attractions. The Abbey ruins and one of the most magnificent gardens you will ever see (in Spring and summer). Other Cotswold sights are a short and lovely drive.\nAll in all, this Hotel merits a highly recommended designation.",5,positive

The bed was very comfortable and the linen top class. The bath and shower were something to treasure, the bath filled up in a couple of minutes and with \""White Company\"" toiletries a very nice touch. Nice teas and Coffees, but perhaps fresh milk in fridge would have been a nice touch.\nTea and scones was very nice indeed and sit outside if the weather is nice. Next door to the Abbey and gardens is a treat, but do venture out for riverside walks, they are hidden but well worth it.\nWe didn't take the option of dinner as it looked a little too much like fine dining for our tastes; however, having sampled the breakfast I think we missed out.

11.43\ca\528773\601569\417938585.html,The Old Bell Hotel,"""I am writing this review in some detail so, for those who don't want detail, here is a synopsis which I hope will help, beneath that the rest is under headings so that you can skip to what you want and leave out the rest. If at the end you feel that I have been of help please tick the Helpful box for which I will be forever in you debt!\n\nIN A NUT SHELL:\nThis hotel has the potential to delight you but you have to appreciate that you get what you pay for.  The hotel is dog friendly, the situation is excellent for exploring the historic town of Malmesbury and the surrounding area, the staff are very good at their jobs, the food is high quality, the bar quite well stocked and the gardens, although smallish, are pleasing and offer a great place to sit out with the drink of your choice on a sunny day.\nDog owners are slightly restricted in where their pet can go at meal times but this should not put you off in any way.  Room prices vary from @ \u00A3110 including breakfast to about double this, (add \u00A310 per day if you are taking your pet), so, since all guests have access to all the other facilities of the hotel, the difference in price is reflected in the quality of the room you get.\n\nTHE DETAIL\nTHE HOTEL - is a Grade 1 listed building that has a great deal of charm but do not expect suits of armour, stone pillars, masses of ancient beams etc. and, of course, air conditioning is not possible.  It was build on the site of a castle and is as close to the ancient abbey as it is possible to get.  The hotel provides maps of places of interest and information about its own history in your room and at reception.\n\nARRIVAL and PARKING  - Guest parking is to the rear of the hotel and reached via a small road to the left of the hotel as you face it.  \nTIP -You can unload and reach reception via a door into the corridor that connects the Coach House to the main building instead of walking to the front of the hotel.\n\nYOUR ROOM - If you are on a limited budget then the Coach House may be for you.  It is connected to the main building by a short all weather corridor.  For an extra \u00A310 you can have a room in the main building.  We chose the main building and were given a room in the upper part of the hotel.  The room was plain but obviously very clean and consisted of a comfortable double bed, wardrobe and dressing table plus an over-the-bath rain shower in an en-suite.  There was adequate space for us and our Labrador.  We liked the good selection of  in room tea and coffee but would have liked a small coffee table and two chairs. There was a limited view from a fairly small window.  I don't like to be too hot at night and an electric fan would have been great.\nTIP - This room was fine for a one night stay but if romantic is what you want then phone the hotel and describe what you want.  More expensive rooms have more space, settees, views, refrigerators etc.  If we go back again for a weekend for two I will pay more.\nEATING & THE BAR - The hotel sources it's meat from a local butcher and the food is high quality and well presented.  As we had a dog with us we could not eat in the main dining area but opted to eat in the adjacent bar which had a nice relaxed atmosphere,(The brasserie is also a quieter option).  There is a reasonable menu,  I had 8oz Sir Loin with chips and salad for \u00A320 and shared a pudding with my wife @ \u00A36-7.  The steak was perfectly cooked to my request and I could not have eaten any more.  Wine starts @ \u00A321 a bottle for red Rioja, the beer is good and reasonably priced and doubles from @ \u00A36 unless you have Hennesy XO at \u00A320 for a double.\nBreakfast was also very pleasant with some interesting options including traditional full English but of a better quality than many hotels we have stayed in. Extra butter, toast, coffee quickly provided on request.\nTIP - Note that breakfast ceases at 9.30 am.  The staff do not rush to pack up but if a lazy morning is what you want it is something to bear in mind.\nDOGS - If you have your best friend with you, inevitably they need a walk somewhere away from the hotel.\nTIP - Exit via the front of the hotel, cross the road and turn left.  Walk along the street until you reach a right angle corner.  A flight of steps on your right leads down to the picturesque riverside, over an ancient stone bridge to open fields of doggy heaven.\n\nFINALLY - My wife loved the hotel , its staff and the general cheerful informality and vows we will return with friends for a few days.\nTIP - This is not a cheap stop over hotel, so if you want romantic and memorable, be prepared to pay a bit more to get the room you want.\n\nDear reader.  Thank you for getting this far - if you have found this helpful in any way please take the time to tick the Helpful box; I really need the points!  In return  I wish you a delightful visit.",4,positive

Whilst checking we explained our predicament and she said she would do her best for us.

We were so thankful I could have thrown my arms around her. We hurried to get our belongings and drove straight across. We were shown to a beautiful room with a huge bed, ample space and a large bathroom with a beautiful roll top bath as feature.

The room we stayed in was nice enough (as you'd expect for \u00A3275) but too many other things have simply been ignored, e.g. the TV remote not working. The big let-down was breakfast where things were really falling apart - all sorts of things missed, or unreasonably late being delivered to our table, buffet items running out and not being replaced, lukewarm coffee and a full English that was pretty much the worst I've ever had.

11.43\ca\528773\601569\448233559.html,The Old Bell Hotel,"""Reluctantly I am giving only 2 stars as our stay was really poor. We ate here with friends about a year ago and the meal was fantastic, so good we said we must return. My wife has not long gone through some medical issues so we decided a night away would be good. We booked a room in the main building and a table for evening meal. When we arrived we weren't overly impressed with the room for \u00A3125 a night even with breakfast included. \n\nThe finish in the room was just quite poor, with a tiny tv, a toilet seat that kept sliding off it's base, no mirror light in the bathroom and marks on the walls by the bed. We overlooked this though as we were excited about the food to come.\n\nWe dressed up and went down to the restaurant and waited a bit to be served. The waitress who took us into the restaurant seemed a bit flustered when my wife asked for the table next to the one she had led us too. It had not long been vacated but the restaurant was less than half full at the time. She wasn't rude but she didn't smile or make us feel at ease. \n\nI ordered pigeon breast and my wife ordered crab. Her crab was actually quite good, but I couldn't cut through my pigeon. It was overcooked and not pink enough. I had it replaced but the replacement wasn't much better with gristle so I left some of it. At this point we were a bit concerned as this seemed quite different to our last visit.\n\nWe kept it simple for mains and went for sirloins, but when they arrived we were really shocked as they were dried out and leathery and we could hardly cut through them. They has been seared a lot on the outside but they were very thin and although they were pink in the middle the meat wasn't very good. Compared to our last visit this was like chalk and cheese as my wife had eaten steak on our last visit and it had been fabulous (as had my meal been which was beef cheek if I recall). \n\nMy family have owned and run restaurants for years and although not a chef I frequently cook steak amongst other things and I felt the quality of the meat wasn't brilliant but it also hadn't been cooked well.\n\nIt was such an anti-climax we sent the meals back and just asked for the bill. They didn't charge us for any food and the waitress (a different one) was very apologetic to us. We went up to our room and ate what was left of a cheese and ham sandwich from lunchtime and that was our dinner. \n\nIn the night my wife was in some pain due to her recent medical situation so we didn't get a lot of sleep. As I knew we might be a bit later than planned for breakfast I looked up breakfast times on the hotel website but couldn't find anything. I also checked my confirmation email but nothing there, and nothing in the room to advise us of breakfast times, just that checking out time was 11am. The reception hadn't advised us about breakfast at check-in either so I was none the wiser. I left it there and we came down for breakfast at 9:45am. We went to reception to ask about a pharmacy for pain killers and were advised on where to go, and although very polite the receptionist didn't ask if everything was ok. \n\nI had also noticed the breakfast was being slowly cleared away and I enquired if we were too late. The receptionist told us we could go and ask them to cook us breakfast and see what the kitchen said, but that we had probably missed the rest of the breakfast items as they get cleared away at 10am. This just left us feeling as though we were being an inconvenience, even though the receptionist was polite.\n\nTo cap it all off when we then checked out we weren't even asked how our stay was, and we just felt like no one really cared. We ended up going for breakfast elsewhere.\n\nWhilst I appreciate there are a number of small items I would usually discount here, they all happened to us on top of a really poor dining experience. I will not be returning again to stay and I feel that we were let down badly on many levels.",2,negative

It is so quiet in there that you fear to have a hushed conversation: hardly the place for professionals to unwind after a long day at work! The owners continue to struggle to find an identity for the place but presumably lack desire to do so whilst they make reasonable gains from Dyson and the faithful who dine at the restaurant. \n\nMalmesbury is a vibrant & diverse town, so it should be able to both tap into this & reflect it. Some of the highest end Cotswold hotels manage to cater for both their local audience & their weekend\u002Fnight away clientele very successfully: e.g the Lygon Arms in Broadway. I would suggest updating the bar seating at the very least, sorting out some ambient music, updating the bar decor & removing some of the photos and prints that are over a decade old (back bar area very tired & outdated now) and serving at least olives and a choice of seasoned nuts all day (even the brewery owned pubs in town have got this right) if they are hell bent on seeing bags of crisps priced at \u00A33 a pop as lacking class. \n\nI'd get a group of guests, locals, regulars and Dyson employees and do some market research. What are people willing to pay for & what do they expect in return? Then have a look at what every other successful Cotswold hotel is doing and apply it. I really hope it improves again because it could really thrive at the heart of the community and offer people a luxurious break away that is more than just the lovely room. ",1,negative

The refurbishment has given the old building a fresh and cared for feel which was definitely overdue.  That said, I did prefer many aspects of the pre-refurbished hotel and restaurant.  We were disappointed to note that the sandwich bar menu has been replaced with a choice of a few tapas style plates.  The bar used to be a proper bar you could wander up to, review the draught ales and order.  We found out via a firm hand on the elbow that this is now discouraged and that it\u2019s table service only.  More present service or a few signs would be helpful!  The food was ok, nothing to complain about or particularly enjoy.  Not sure if we made bad choices or if the quality has dropped.  We found the restaurant to be very expensive for only adequate food.  Nothing particularly wrong or bad, just not the quality we\u2019ve enjoyed there previously and definitely at a premium.

It was cold in our room when we arrived, and when I mentioned this at reception I was offered a heater, which was good. However, we were just going out, so I didn't bother. Had we been staying longer, I would have taken advantage of this offer. Staff were very obliging, and I was impressed that on checking out, the receptionist made a note of a couple of suggestions I made. This hotel clearly has a role as a local meeting place as well as a residential hotel, with the pluses and minuses this involves.",4,positive

Just about 15 mins north of the M4 (Jct 17) Malmesbury is a delightful small town with a 10th century Abbey and is the seat of King Athelstan. Modern historians regard him as the first King of England and one of the greatest Anglo-Saxon kings. The Old Bell is a fine place to stay and is located right next to Malmesbury Abbey. The hotel provided a very comfortable ensuite room. In fact they upgraded us when they knew it was my wife's birthday. The bathroom was huge with a double shower and magnificent roll-top bath. We slept very well in the large double. Breakfast was fresh and plentiful with full English and lesser dishes (poached eggs, scrambled eggs, etc) straight from the kitchen if the buffet wasn't enough. The hotel has a lovely bar and a number of comfortable sitting rooms to relax with a newspaper and a drink. Staff were friendly and welcoming especially the Irish guy who seemed to be in charge of the dining room & bar. There was plenty of free parking and the hotels location in the centre of the town right next to the abbey was unbeatable. Across the road and down a flight of steps to a lovely stroll by the River Avon (Tetbury Branch). We ate in the hotel restaurant one night and the food was good. on another evening we drove to Tetbury (13 mins) and enjoyed an Italian at Casa La Cucina Italiana restaurant in Long Street. While we were staying at Malmesbury we visited the very excellent Bowood House (35 mins) and Lacock Abbey & Village (26 mins). Corsham Court was also on the list but we ran short of time.\nYou won't be disappointed if you stay at The Old Bell Hotel in Malmesbury.",5,positive

He took our order for lunch at the same time. 15 minutes later a waitress brought our starters through to the bar area. I explained we had booked a table a week earlier, the Manager knew this earlier and he had asked us to wait until he found us a nice table. The waitress took the starters away. A couple of minutes later we were sat at a table to hear the couple behind us telling the waiter they would never come back, I was apprehensive, and our starters brought out. My wife had pate but I was surprised it wasn\u2019t accompanied by bread or toast. After we had finished our starter the Manager asked if we didn\u2019t want bread or water, I replied \u201Cwe weren\u2019t offered\u201D.

Ironically my wife said her fish was the best she has had in a long time and my lamb the worst meal in my life (see photo of what was inedible).\nI complained and the manager said he would have words with the butcher, yes the butcher. Sir I suggest you have words with the chef who cooked this mess, the person who carved and plated it and whoever allowed it to go over the pass\u00E9. Total disgrace, and the chef should be ashamed of a meal that does not do this great hotel justice.\nMy compensation by the way was a beer!!! Cheers for ruining our day",1,negative

Which was perfect. After a 5 hour drive down we pulled into the car park and made our way to reception. \n\nMy 2 stars above are awarded to the lovely young girl at reception who checked us in quickly. Supplied information that was relevant to us and off we went. We were in  the room directly above reception. The room was very big and spacious with a long size bed. One small desk and chair. A small place to hang clothes. No draws etc as this is a travel lodge. Bathroom was clean and small but doable. I noticed under the bed that there were pull out beds to create a family room and I pulled them out and asked the lady at reception if we could use them as it would make life a little easier whilst we stayed to have an additional bed. She was very quick to arrange this and therefore ended up with 2 double beds in our room. \n\nAfter unpacking a little we headed over to the milkchurn pub across the way as it gets good ratings to be let down. We sat at a bar table which had been cleaned but was very sticky. I had to ask 3 members of staff how do I order food, with not much help giving. Once I placed my order we waited 50 mins for food to arrive and the place was empty. They have no soft drinks on tap just bottled and found it to be very expensive. \u00A340+ for 2 people for a main meal and drink. This was the only night we eat here. Other nights we are out. \n\nWhat I am really appalled at by this hotel is staying for 5 days neither bed sheets were changed. The floors were not hoovered. I accidentally split talc all over the bathroom and was still over the bathroom the night we returned. And the next day. I even attempted to wipe up myself using the towels which I placed I  the bath to be changed. Only to find them hung back up on the towel hanger. \n\nTo add to this we had noticed our coffee was not tasting right after using the their in room facilities. Only to discover on the 3rd day that our dirty cups were also not been changed. They were just been rinished and placed back on the table. The cups are made of rough porcelain and and after looking at the cups more closely dust were all over the cups. Therefore for 3 days we had been drinking out of dirty, dusted unwashed cups. After day 3 I survived of bottle water and we also made our own beds everyday too. \n\nThis hotel can be noisy as it's part of an industrial estate where workers come and go. Greggs downstairs comes in really handy on a morning for coffee and breakfast. Etc. \n\nThe morning we checked out I came to reception to not only hand my key back but to ask reception for some additional information. There was no one there so I pressed the buzzer that is supplied with a note saying 'press the buzzer to find me and I will be straight with you' over 15 mins I stood there. X4 times I pressed the buzzer only to learn all staff had been in the office right at reception laughing and carrying on. Only then to walk out and all x3 staff went outside and lit up cigarettes completely ignoring me. I found this very very rude. Unprofessional. Complete with A real bad attitude.

This is an excellent family run hotel and restaurant. The main reason we chose this hotel in 2010 was because they welcome people like ourselves, who own well behaved dogs.  The hotel is homely, very comfortable and in a peaceful setting with charming staff. It is also very conveniently situated for many of the popular Wiltshire tourist venues. This year we chose to have our evening meals at the hotel and were delighted with the choice on offer, the bar-meals were first rate, well presented & served . You could also choose to have your meal in the excellent a la carte restaurant - and at very reasonable prices  After a busy time during the day it was so good to have a quiet meal in such a relaxing setting.  \n \nThe menu choice for breakfast was also very  comprehensive offering the usual fruit juices; cereals, grapefruit, full breakfast etc. but also on the menu was fresh fruit salad. This proved to be no ordinary fresh fruit salad but a carefully prepared dish made when ordered and a complete surprise when so beautifully served. A photograph is enclosed as it looked so tempting and yes - it was delicious. All meals are appetizing to both eye and palate. Congratulations to the chef on the superb quality and presentation of all the food that is served at every meal.\n \nThe following is a personal anecdote but serves to exempIify how very caring the owners and staff of the Shaw County House Hotel are.  Nothing is too much trouble to them.  Last year we had a sick dog with us - she was becoming frail and was refusing all food. Just as we were leaving the Chef came out with a piece of beautiful freshly cooked steak, chopped into small chunks and told me to try her with the meat. She hesitatly started eating it and from then on she began her normal eating habits again until her death four months later at the age of nearly 15 years. This kind gesture will never be forgotten by myself and my husband.",5,positive

Set back from the Bath Road, behind some trees and bushes the place was suitably quiet and the atmosphere informal and relaxed.  First impressions are good however the staircase up to the rooms is narrow, with a mid-way 180 degree turn around and fire door at the top - both awkward if you have both hands full (i.e. overnight case and laptop bag).  The single rooms with en suite were both clean and comfortable.  Mine had a compact shower cubicle, which delivered an excellent early morning shower while my colleague's had a bath with in-bath shower.\n\nBack downstairs the bar is comfortable, clean, neat and tidy with a good range of drinks.  Meals can be had in either the bar or restaurant irrespective of which menu you order from.  We ordered a simple choice from the menu expecting typical pub fayre when told the portions were \""massive\"".  Wow, were we surprised, more accurately, blown away.  Not by the size of the portions (not as large as described) but by the quality - which is the right way round for me.  Both portions proved spot on for our appetites, and the deserts are to die for.\n\nSo, the perfect place to stop over?  Very nearly.  We both found the rooms got too hot during the night so windows got opened, and my room floor creaked with every step so a nocturnal trip to the loo was broadcast to everybody.

There is a good a la carte menu, but we opted to select from the slightly more limited \""residents menu\"" which was even better than that shown on their web page. I had read that Nick and Paul were masters in their kitchen, but even so was surprised by the quality, presentation and flavours of the food. The wine list is also very good, and reasonably priced.\n\nWe are unlikely to return to Shaw, but I will gladly recommend the Shaw Country House Hotel to anyone who visits the area and wants to stay in a comfortable, friendly, reasonably priced hotel, with character (it is after all 300+ years old, a bit creaky in parts (rather like me!), with some disconcertingly uneven floors).",5,positive

Room spotless and comfortable. Excellent service at a meal for twelve all in a delightful setting. Food well presented and well cooked with very wide choice.

The car park has plenty of space and is close to the entrance.  \n\nI was met with a pleasant greeting and a checked in quickly.  My room was small but perfectly formed for an over night... it was clean and well presented and the bed comfy, with a selection of pillows of different firmness.  The bathroom again small, but clean and functional.  I slept well as it was so quiet and wonderfully warm.\n\nI had a bar meal in the evening.  Don't let the tired menus put you off, I had a steak sandwich with salad and chips and it was fab!  Chef cooked the steak perfectly. The beer selection is limited to bottles.\n\nBreakfast was great, I ordered off menu and got a plate of scrambled eggs and toast, just what I wanted.

The room was en-suite and the bathroom had a shower and a fantastic bath. It was clean and fresh. The room was also clean and very nice, could not fault it.

The hotel kindly emailed me to say they had a wedding for the night I was staying so the restaurant was closed and car parking could not be guaranteed.  We were hiring an E-Type Jag and had to have guaranteed parking overnight and friends and family were meeting us for a meal.  When I contacted the hotel to enquire about the changes I was told that it was a business and of course they were going to take in a wedding with 80 guests.  What about me?  I am also a customer and am appalled at the treatment I experienced and the lack of empathy from the manager, Emma, whom I spoke to.  Needless to say I have cancelled and booked somewhere else where I have been treated how I expect, like a paying customer that is important. As I hadn't booked a table at the restaurant they were closing it, if I had booked one they wouldn't have done although there is nothing on line to say you have to book in advance.  I was also appalled that I was treated with indifference and that I did not matter.
